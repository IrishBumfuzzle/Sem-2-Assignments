there had been signs and portents like the regular toppling over and defacing of the bust of lauro di bosis near the villa lante and in the gianicolo. something was happening all right , slowly it is true , but you could feel it. the italians felt it. little things. an italian poet had noticed plainclothes policemen lounging around the area of quirinal palace , the first time since the war. at least they had not stepped up and asked to see papers in the hated , flat , dialect mispronunciation of mussolini's home district dogumenti , per favore. but , who knew , that might be coming one of these days. there were other italians who still bore scars they had earned in police station basements , resisting. they laughed and , true to national form and manners , never talked long or solemnly on any subject at all , but some of them worried out loud about short memories and ghosts. we saw giuseppe berto at a party once in a while , tall , lean , nervous and handsome , and , in our opinion , the best novelist of them all except pavese , and pavese is dead. berto's the sky is red had been a small masterpiece and in its special way the best book to come out of the war. now he was married to a beautiful girl , had a small son , and lived in an expensive apartment and worked for the movies. on his desk was a slowly accumulating treatment and script of the count of monte cristo. on his bookshelves were some of the latest american novels , including bellow's seize the day , but he had not read them they were sent by american publishers and was not especially interested in what the american writers were up to. he was interested in robert musil's the man without qualities. so were a lot of other people. he was interested in italo svevo. he was thinking his way into a new novel , a big one , one that people had been waiting for. it was going to be hard going all the way because he had not written seriously for a while , except for a few stories , was tired of the old method of realismo he had so successfully used in the sky is red. this one was going to be different. he had bought a little piece of property down along the coast of the hard country of calabria that he knew so well. he was going to do one or two more films for cash and then chuck it all , leave rome and its intellectual cliques and money-fed life , go back to calabria. berto seemed worried , too. he knew all about it and had put it down in journal form in the war in a black shirt , a wonderful book not , for some strange reason , published in the u.s.. he knew all about the appeal of a black shirt and jackboots to a poor , southern , peasant boy. he knew all about the infection and the fever , and , too , the moment of realization when he saw for himself , threw up his hands and quit , ended the war as a prisoner in texas. berto knew all about fascism. so did his friend , the young novelist rimanelli. rimanelli is tough and square-built and adventurous , says what he thinks. he had put it down in a war novel , the day of the lion. these people were not talking much about it , but you , a foreigner , sensed their apprehension and disappointment. so there we were talking around and about it. the english lady said she had to go to vienna for a while. it was a pity because she had planned to lay a wreath at the foot of the garibaldi statue , towering over rome in spectacular benediction from the highpoint of the gianicolo. around that statue in the green park where children play and lovers walk in twos and there is a glowing view of the whole city , in that park are the rows of marble busts of garibaldi's fallen men , the ones who one day rushed out of the porta san pancrazio and , under fire all the way , up the long , straight narrow lane to take , then lose the high ground of the villa doria pamphili. when they lost it , the french artillery moved in , and that was the end for garibaldi that time , on 30 april 1849. once out of the gate they had charged straight up the narrow lane. we had walked it many times and shivered , figuring what a fish barrel it had been for the french. now the park is filled with marble busts and all the streets in the immediate area have the full and proper names of the men who fell. we were at a party once and heard an idealistic young european call that awful charge glorious. our companion was a huge , plain-spoken american sculptor who had been a sixteen-year-old rifleman all across france in 1944. he said it was stupid butchery to order men to make a charge like that , no matter who gave the order and what for. " oh , it would be butchery all right "" , the european said. " we would see it that way , but it was glorious then. it was the last time in history anybody could do something gloriously like that "". i thought : who is older now ? ? old world and new world. the sculptor looked at him , bugeyed and amazed , angry. he had made an assault once with 180 men. it was a picked assault company. they went up against an ss unit of comparable size , over a little rise of ground , over an open field. object a village crossroads. they made it , killed every last one of the krauts , took the village on schedule. when it was over , eight of his company were still alive and all eight were wounded. the whole thing , from the moment when they jumped heavily off the trucks , spread out and moved into position just behind the cover of that slight rise of ground and then jumped off , took maybe between twenty and thirty minutes. the sculptor looked at him , let the color drain out of his face , grinned , and looked down into his drink , a bad martini made with raw italian gin. " bullshit "" , he said softly. " excuse me "" , the european said. " i am not familiar with the expression "". the apartment where we were talking that afternoon in march faced onto the street garibaldi's men had charged up and along. across the way from the apartment building is a ruined house , shot to hell that day in 1849 , and left that way as a memorial. there is a bronze wreath on the wall. like everything else in rome , ruins and monuments alike , that house is lived in. i have seen diapers strung across the ruined roof. the english lady really wanted to put a wreath on the garibaldi monument on the 30th of april. she had her reasons for this. for one thing , there was not going to be any ceremony at all this year. there were a few reasons for that , too : garibaldi had been taken up and exploited by the communists nowadays. therefore the government wanted no part of him. it is sort of as if our government should decide to disown washington or lincoln for the same reason. and then there were ecclesiastical matters , the matter of garibaldi's anti-clericalism. there was a new pope and the vatican was making itself heard and felt these days. as it happens the english lady is a good catholic herself , but of more liberal political persuasion. nothing was going to be done this year to celebrate garibaldi's bold and unsuccessful defense of rome. all that the english lady wanted to do was to walk up to the monument and lay a wreath at its base. this would show that somebody , even a foreigner living in rome , cared. and then there were other things. some of the marble busts in the park are of young englishmen who fought and died for garibaldi. she also mentioned leaving a little bunch of flowers at the bust of lauro di bosis. it is hard for me to know how i feel about lauro di bosis. i suffer from mixed feelings. he was a well-to-do , handsome , and sensitive young poet. his bust shows an intense , mustached , fine-featured face. he flew over rome one day during the early days of mussolini and scattered leaflets over the city , denouncing the fascists. he was never heard of again. he is thought either to have been killed by the fascists as soon as he landed or to have killed himself by flying out to sea and crashing his plane. he was , thus , an early and spectacular victim. and there is something so wonderfully romantic about it all. he really did not know how to fly. he had crashed on takeoff once before. gossip had it for gossip is the soul of rome that a famous american dancer of the time had paid for both the planes. it was absurd and dramatic. it is remembered and has been commemorated by a bust in a park and a square in the city which was renamed piazzo lauro di bosis after the war. most romans , even some postmen , know it by the old name. faced with a gesture like di bosis" , i find usually that my sentiments are closer to those of my sculptor friend. the things that happened in police station basements were dirty , grubby , and most often anonymous. no poetry , no airplanes , no dancers. that is how the real routine of resistance goes on , and its strength is directly proportionate to the number of insignificant people who can let themselves be taken to pieces , piece by piece , without quitting. it is an ugly business and there are few , if any , wreaths for them. i keep thinking of a young woman i knew during the occupation in austria. she was from prague. she had been picked up by the russians , questioned in connection with some pamphlets , sentenced to life imprisonment for espionage. she escaped , crawled through the usual mine fields , under barbed wire , was shot at , swam a river , and we finally picked her up in linz. she showed us what had happened to her. no airplanes , no nathan hale statements. just no spot , not even a dimesize spot , on her whole body that was not bruised , bruise on top of bruise , from beatings. i understand very well about lauro di bosis and how his action is symbolic. the trouble is that like many symbols it does not seem a very realistic one. the english lady wanted to pay tribute to garibaldi and to lauro di bosis , but she was not going to be here to do it. were any of us interested enough in the idea to do it for her , by proxy so to speak ? ? there was a pretty thorough silence at that point. my spoon stirring coffee , banging against the side of the cup , sounded as loud as a bell. i thought : what the hell ? ? why not ? ? i said i would do it for her. i had some reasons , too. i admire the english lady. i hate embarrassing silences and have been known to make a fool out of myself just to prevent one. i also had and have feelings about garibaldi. like every southerner i cannot escape the romantic tradition of brave defeats , forlorn lost causes. though garibaldi's fight was small shakes compared to pickett's charge which , like all southerners , i view in almost miltonic terms , fallen angels , etc. i associated the two. and to top it all i am often sentimental on purpose , trying to prove to myself that i am not afraid of sentiment. so much for all that. the english lady was pleased and enthusiastic. she gave me the names of some people who would surely help pay for the flowers and might even march up to the monument with me. the idea of the march pleased her. maybe twenty , thirty , fifty. maybe i could call rimanelli at the magazine rottosei where he worked.

in general , religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis ; ; congregational membership , however , is another thing. a congregation survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership ; ; that is , when it can preserve economic integration. religious faith can be considered a necessary condition of membership in a congregation , since the decision to join a worshiping group requires some motive force , but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining ; ; the presence of other members of similar social and economic level is the sufficient condition. the breakdown of social homogeneity in inner city areas and the spread of inner city blight account for the decline of central city churches. central cities reveal two adverse features for the major denominations : 1 central cities tend to be areas of residence for lower social classes ; ; 2 central cities tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition. the central city areas , in other words , exhibit the two characteristics which violate the life principle of congregations of the major denominations : they have too few middle-class people ; ; they mix middle-class people with lower-class residents. central city areas have become progressively poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus of middle-class people from most central cities. with few exceptions , the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central city. the key to protestant development , therefore , is economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation. members of higher and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus , so that protestant figures on social class give the impression of spread over all social classes ; ; but this is deceptive , for the core of membership is concentrated in a single social and economic stratum. the congregation perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the neighborhood ; ; moreover , residential mobility is so high in metropolitan areas that churches have to recruit constantly in their core stratum in order to survive ; ; they can lose higher- and lower-status members from the church without collapsing , but they need adequate recruits for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration. the congregation is first and foremost an economic peer group ; ; it is secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship. if it were primarily a believing fellowship , it would recruit believers from all social and economic ranks , something which most congregations of the new protestantism with a few notable exceptions have not been able to do. they survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers. the vulnerability of protestant congregations to social differences has often been attributed to the " folksy spirit "" of protestant religious life ; ; in fact , a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the " impersonal "" roman catholic parish. we have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers ; ; consequently , the vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in protestant congregations ; ; actually , there is little evidence of such personal community in protestant congregations , as we shall see in another connection. the vulnerability of protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life , where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform , therefore , to the principle of economic integration. this fact is evident in the recruitment of new members. mission as co-optation the rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations. there is much talk in theological circles about the " church as mission "" and the " church's mission "" ; ; theologians have been stressing the fact that the church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world. a crucial question , therefore , is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan protestantism. if economic integration really shapes congregational life , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration. the task of a congregation would be defined , according to economic integration , as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation. co-optation means to choose by joint action in order to fill a vacancy ; ; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in order to strengthen an organization. in a mobile society , congregational health depends on a constant process of recruitment ; ; this recruitment , however , must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation ; ; therefore , the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather than proclamation like elements will have to be assimilated. evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches ; ; one study in pittsburgh , however , has illuminated the situation. in a sample of new members of pittsburgh churches , almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial " contacts with friendly members "". if we add to these contacts with friendly members the " contacts with an organization of the church "" 11.2 per cent of the cases , then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through friendly contact. on the surface , this seems a sound approach to christian mission : members of the congregation show by their friendly attitudes that they care for new people ; ; the new people respond in kind by joining the church. missionary outreach by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods ; ; the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position ; ; association by level of achievement is the dominant principle of informal relations. this means that the antennae of the congregation are extended into the community , picking up the wave lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation ; ; the mission of the church is actually a process of informal co-optation ; ; the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation. churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration ; ; once the pool of recruits diminishes , the congregation is helpless friendly contacts no longer keep it going. the transmutation of mission to co-optation is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities , worship , preaching , and publicity in reaching new members. the proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts by the clergy 17.3 per cent of new members and friendly contacts by members over two thirds if organizational activities are included. publicity accounted for 1.1 per cent of the initial contacts with new members. in general , friendly contact with a member followed by contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment by the churches , making it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission in the contemporary church ; ; economic integration and co-optation are the two methods by which protestants associate with and recruit from the neighborhood. the inner life of congregations will prosper so long as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together ; ; the outer life of congregations the suitability of the environment to their survival will be propitious so long as the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the membership. economic integration ceases when the social and economic statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation. in a rapidly changing society congregations will run into difficulties repeatedly , since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single generation. the fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle to maintain economic balance. the expense of this type of organization in religious life , when one recalls the number of city churches which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned , raises fundamental questions about the principle of protestant survival in a mobile society ; ; nonetheless , the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the protestant development. it was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings. these trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis. residential associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions. the motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential communities have polarized ; ; the schism between central city and suburb , negro and white , blue collar and white collar can be viewed as symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis. it now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved with the economy of middle-class culture , for it serves to crystallize the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings. the accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations. this conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment. more than creatures of metropolitan forces , the churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan life , crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of peoples , giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous peoples. since american life is committed above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life , the countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have fought a desperate , rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis. consumer communities have suffered at the hands of the productive interests. negroes , puerto ricans , and rural newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities. soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs , and the churches will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized their history for a century. the identification of the basic unit of religious organization the parish or congregation with a residential area is self-defeating in a modern metropolis , for it simply means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation. mission to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential community , because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan interdependence with residential exclusion. this interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projections for the churches. it could be argued that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle classes. it could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain religious activity , since worship presupposes some local stabilities. whatever projection one makes , the striking fact about congregational and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people. attention will be given in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational churches ; ; this style is characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle classes. the keynotes of this style are activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem. these values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman , dictating the methods of child rearing , determining the pattern of community participation , setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of middle-class illness , and informing the congregational life of the major denominations. " fellowship by likeness "" and " mission by friendly contact "" form the iron cage of denominational religion. its contents are another matter , for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued by the congregation. what goes on in the cage will occupy our attention under the rubric of the organization church. an understanding of the new role of residential association in an industrial society serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity. the perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs and charities should fill the same need.

trevelyan's liberalism was above all a liberalism of the spirit , a deep feeling of communion with men fighting for country and for liberty. his passion and enthusiasm convey the courage and high adventure of garibaldi's exploits and give the reader a unique sense of participation in the events described. the three volumes brought to the fore a characteristic of trevelyan's prose which remained conspicuous through his later works a genius for describing military action with clarity and with authority. the confused rambling of guerrilla warfare , such as most of garibaldi's campaigns were , was brought to life by trevelyan's pen in some of the best passages in the books. his personal familiarity with the scenes of action undoubtedly contributed much to the final result , but familiarity alone would not have been enough without other qualities. military knowledge , love of detail , and a sure feeling for the portrayal of action were the added ingredients. but the garibaldi volumes were more than a romantic story. trevelyan contributed considerable new knowledge of the issues connected with his subject. the outstanding example was in garibaldi and the thousand , where he made use of unpublished papers of lord john russell and english consular materials to reveal the motives which led the british government to permit garibaldi to cross the straits of messina. in looking back over the volumes , it is possible to find errors of interpretation , some of which were not so evident at the time of writing. thus trevelyan repeats the story which pictured victor emmanuel as refusing to abandon the famous statuto at the insistence of general radetzky. later research has shown this part of the legend of the re galantuomo to be false. trevelyan accepts italian nationalism with little analysis , he is unduly critical of papal and french policy , and he is more than generous in assessing british policy. but fifty years later the trilogy still maintains a firm place in the list of standard works on the unification of italy , a position cautiously prophesied by the reviewers at the time of publication. trevelyan's manin and the venetian revolution of 1848 , his last major volume on an italian theme , was written in a minor key. published in 1923 , it did not gain the popular acclaim of the garibaldi volumes , probably because trevelyan felt less at home with manin , the bourgeois lawyer , than with garibaldi , the filibuster. the complexities of venetian politics eluded him , but the story of the revolution itself is told in restrained measures , with no superfluous passages and only an occasional overemphasis of the part played by its leading figure. if it is not one of his best books , it can only be considered unsatisfactory when compared with his own garibaldi. already trevelyan had begun to parallel his nineteenth-century italian studies with several works on english figures of the same period. first the life of john bright appeared and seven years later lord grey of the reform bill. of the two , the life of bright is incomparably the better biography. trevelyan centers too exclusively on bright , is insufficiently appreciative of the views of bright's opponents and critics , and makes light of the genuine difficulties faced by peel. yet he is right when he claims in his autobiography that he drew the real features of the man , his tender and selfless motives and his rugged fearless strength. in the story of bright and the corn law agitation , the crimean war , the american civil war , and the franchise struggle trevelyan reflects something of the moral power which enabled this independent man to exercise so immense an influence over his fellow countrymen for so long. because bright's speeches were so much a part of him , there are long and numerous quotations , which , far from making the biography diffuse , help to give us the feel of the man. associated in a sense with the manchester school through his mother's family , trevelyan conveys in this biography something of its moral conviction and drive. nineteenth-century virtues , however , seem somehow to have gone out of fashion and the bright book has never been particularly popular. the biography of lord grey is strictly speaking not a biography at all. it is a whig history of the " tory reaction "" which preceded the reform bill of 1832 , and it uses the figure of grey to give some unity to the narrative. the volume is a piece of passionate special pleading , written with the heat and often with the wisdom , it must be said of a liberal damning the shortsightedness of politicians from 1782 to 1832. characteristically , trevelyan enjoyed writing the work. the theme of glorious summer coming after a long winter of discontent and repression was , he has told us , congenial to his artistic sense. and grey's northumberland background was close to trevelyan's own. but his concentration on personalities and his categorical assessment of their actions fail to convey the political complexities of a long generation harassed by world-wide war and confronted with the problem of adjustment to an unprecedented industrial and social transformation. some historians have found his point of view not to their taste , others have complained that he makes the tory tradition appear " contemptible rather than intelligible "" , while a sympathetic critic has remarked that the " intricate interplay of social dynamics and political activity of which , at times , politicians are the ignorant marionettes is not a field for the exercise of his talents "". the liberal-radical heritage which informs all of trevelyan's interpretations of history here seems clearly to have distorted the issues and oversimplified the period. for once his touch deserted him. research in the period of grey and bright led naturally to a more ambitious work. britain in the nineteenth century is a textbook designed " to give the sense of continuous growth , to show how economic led to social , and social to political change , how the political events reacted on the economic and social , and how new thoughts and new ideals accompanied or directed the whole complicated process "". the plan is admirably fulfilled for the period up to 1832. more temperately than in the study of grey and despite his liberal bias , trevelyan vividly sketches the england of pre-french revolution days , portrays the stresses and strains of the revolutionary period in rich colors , and brings developments leading to the reform bill into sharp and clear focus. his technique is genuinely masterful. by what one reader called a " series of dissolving views "" , he merges one period into another and gives a sense of continuous growth. but after 1832 , the narrative tends to lose its balanced , many-sided quality and to become a medley of topics , often unconnected by any single thread. economic analysis was never trevelyan's strong point and the england of the industrial transformation cries out for economic analysis. yet after 1832 , the interrelations of economic and social and political affairs become blurred and the narrative becomes largely a conventional political account. finally , the period after 1870 receives little attention and that quite superficial. yet britain in the nineteenth century became the vade mecum of beginning students of history , went through edition after edition , and continues to be reprinted up to the very present. its success is a tribute , above all , to trevelyan's brilliance as a literary stylist. in 1924 trevelyan traveled to the united states , where he delivered the lowell lectures at harvard university. these lectures formed the nucleus of a general survey of english development which took form afterward as a history of england. in short order , the general history became his most popular work and has remained , aside from his later social history , the work most widely favored by the public. the history of england has often been compared with green's short history. like green , trevelyan aimed to write a history not of " english kings or english conquests "" , but of the english people. the result was fortunate. the history takes too much for granted to serve as a text for other than english schoolboys , and like britain in the nineteenth century it deteriorates badly as it goes beyond 1870. trevelyan's excursions into contemporary history were rarely happy ones. but as a stimulating , provocative interpretation of the broad sweep of english development it is incomparable. living pictures of the early boroughs , country life in tudor and stuart times , the impact of the industrial revolution compete with sensitive surveys of language and literature , the common law , parliamentary development. the strength of the history is also its weakness. trevelyan is militantly sure of the superiority of english institutions and character over those of other peoples. his nationalism was not a new characteristic , but its self-consciousness , even its self-satisfaction , is more obvious in a book that stretches over the long reach of english history. and yet the elements which capture his liberal and humanistic imagination are those which make the english story worth telling and worth remembering. tolerance and compromise , social justice and civil liberty , are today too often in short supply for one to be overly critical of trevelyan's emphasis on their central place in the english tradition. like most major works of synthesis , the history of england is informed by the positive views of a first-class mind , and this is surely a major work. four years after the publication of the history of england , the first volume of trevelyan's queen anne trilogy appeared. by now he had become regius professor of modern history at cambridge and had been honored by the award of the order of merit. his academic duties had little evident effect on his prolific pen. blenheim was followed in rapid succession by ramillies and the union with scotland and by the peace and the protestant succession , the three forming together a detailed picture of england under queen anne. like his volume on wycliffe , the work was accompanied by the publication of a selected group of documents , in this case illustrative of the history of queen anne's reign down to 1707. trevelyan was at least in part attracted to the period by an almost unconscious desire to take up the story where macaulay's history of england had broken off. in addition , he believed in the " dramatic unity and separateness of the period from 1702-14 , lying between the stuart and hanoverian eras with a special ethos of its own "". he saw the age as one in which britain " settled her free constitution "" and attained her modern place in the world. to most observers , there is little doubt that he placed an artificial strait jacket of unity upon the years of anne's reign which in reality existed only in the pages of his history. of the three volumes , blenheim is easily the best. in four opening chapters reminiscent of macaulay's famous third chapter , trevelyan surveys the state of england at the opening of the eighteenth century. his delightful picture of society and institutions is filled with warm detail that brings the period vividly to life. he tends to underestimate or perhaps to view charitably the brutality and the violence of the age , so that there is an idyllic quality in these pages which hazes over some of its sharp reality. yet as an evocation of time past , there are few such successful portraits in english historical literature. once the scene is set , trevelyan skilfully builds up the tense story until it reaches its climax in the dramatic victory of marlborough and eugene of savoy at blenheim. the account of the battle is , next to his descriptions of garibaldi's campaigns , trevelyan's outstanding military narrative. the scene is etched in sharp detail , the military problems brilliantly explained , and the excitement and importance of the battle made evident. if only for this modest masterpiece of military history , blenheim is likely to be read and reread long after newer interpretations have perhaps altered our picture of the marlborough wars. ramillies and the union with scotland has fewer high spots than blenheim and much less of its dramatic unity. yet in several chapters on scotland in the eighteenth century , trevelyan copes persuasively with the tangled confusion of scottish politics against a vivid background of scottish religion , customs , and traditions.

can thermonuclear war be set off by accident ? ? what steps have been taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the destruction of continents ? ? are we as safe as we should be from such a disaster ? ? is anything being done to increase our margin of safety ? ? will the danger increase or decrease ? ? i have just asked these questions in the pentagon , in the white house , in offices of key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl for months underwater , with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as " sherwood forest "". i asked the same questions inside the launch-control rooms of an atlas missile base in wyoming , where officers who wear sidearms are manning the " commit buttons "" that could start a war accidentally or by design and in the command centers where other pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons. to the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits , submarine compartments and the antiseptic , windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of tomorrow's impersonal intercontinental wars , the questions seem farfetched. there is unceasing pressure , but its sources are immediate. " readiness exercises "" are almost continuous. each could be the real thing. in the command centers there are special clocks ready to tick off the minutes elapsed since " e hour "". " e "" stands for " execution "" the moment a " go order "" would unleash an american nuclear strike. there is little time for the men in the command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks. they are preoccupied riding herd on control panels , switches , flashing colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look like business machines. they know little about their machinery beyond mechanical details. accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks. among the policy makers , generals , physicists , psychologists and others charged with controlling the actions of the button pushers and their " hardware "" , the answers to my questions varied partly according to a man's flair for what the professionals in this field call " scenarios "". as an air force psychiatrist put it : " you cannot have dry runs on this one "". the experts are thus forced to hypothesize sequences of events that have never occurred , probably never will but possibly might. only one rule prevailed in my conversations with these men : the more highly placed they are that is , the more they know the more concerned they have become. already accidental war is a silent guest at the discussions within the kennedy administration about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions of national security. only recently new " holes "" were discovered in our safety measures , and a search is now on for more. work is under way to see whether new restraining devices should be installed on all nuclear weapons. meanwhile , the experts speak of wars triggered by " false pre-emption "" , " escalation "" , " unauthorized behavior "" and other terms that will be discussed in this report. they inhabit a secret world centered on " go codes "" and " gold phones "". their conversations were , almost invariably , accompanied by the same gestures arms and pointed forefingers darting toward each other in arclike semicircular motions. one arm represented our bombers and missiles , the other arm " theirs "". yet implicit in each movement was the death of millions , perhaps hundreds of millions , perhaps you and me and the experts. these men are not callous. it is their job to think about the unthinkable. unanimously they believe that the world would become a safer place if more of us and more russians and communist chinese , too thought about accidental war. the first systematic thinking about this pandora's box within pandora's boxes was done four years ago by fred ikle , a frail , meek-mannered swiss-born sociologist. he was , and is , with the rand corporation , a nonprofit pool of thinkers financed by the u.s. air force. his investigations made him the paul revere of accidental war , and safety procedures were enormously increased. in recent weeks , as a result of a sweeping defense policy reappraisal by the kennedy administration , basic united states strategy has been modified and large new sums allocated to meet the accidental-war danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible. the chain starts at bmews ballistic missile early warning system in thule , greenland. its radar screens would register soviet missiles shortly after they are launched against the united states. bmews intelligence is simultaneously flashed to norad north american air defense command in colorado springs , colorado , for interpretation ; ; to the sac command and control post , forty-five feet below the ground at offutt air force base , near omaha , nebraska ; ; to the joint war room of the joint chiefs of staff in the pentagon and to the president. telephones , teletypes , several kinds of radio systems and , in some cases , television , link all vital points. alternate locations exist for all key command centers. for last-ditch emergencies sac has alternate command posts on kc-135 jet tankers. multiple circuits , routings and frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible. the same principle of " redundancy "" applies to all communications on these special networks. and no messages can be transmitted on these circuits until senders and receivers authenticate in advance , by special codes , that the messages actually come from their purported sources. additional codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications. only the president is permitted to authorize the use of nuclear weapons. that is the law. but what if somebody decides to break it ? ? the president cannot personally remove the safety devices from every nuclear trigger. he makes the momentous decision. hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the button pushers and to push the buttons. what if one or more of them turn irrational or suddenly , coolly , decide to clobber the russians ? ? what if the president himself , in the language of the military , " goes ape "" ? ? or singlehandedly decided to reverse national policy and hit the soviets without provocation ? ? nobody can be absolutely certain of the answers. however , the system is designed , ingeniously and hopefully , so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war. even the president cannot pick up his telephone and give a " go "" order. even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike the " go code "". in an emergency he would receive available intelligence on the " gold-phone circuit "". a system of " gold "" actually yellow phones connects him with the offices and action stations of the secretary of defense , the joint chiefs of staff , the sac commander and other key men. all can be connected with the gold circuit from their homes. all could help the president make his decision. the talk would not be in code , but neither would it ramble. vital questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda. officers who participate in the continual practice drills assured me that the president's decision could be made and announced on the gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from aj. if communications work , his decision would be instantly known in all command posts that would originate the actual go order. for these centers , too , are on the gold circuit. they include the navy's atlantic command at norfolk , virginia , which is in contact with the polaris subs ; ; nato headquarters in europe ; ; air force forward headquarters in europe and in the pacific , which control tactical fighters on ships and land bases ; ; and sac , which controls long-range bombers and atlas missiles. let us look in on one of these nerve centers sac at omaha and see what must still happen before a wing of b-52 bombers could drop their aj. in a word , plenty. the key man almost certainly would be col. william w. wisman , sac's senior controller. he or his deputy or one of their seven assistants , all full colonels , mans the heart of the command post twenty-four hours a day. it is a quiet but impressive room 140 feet long , thirty-nine feet wide , twenty-one feet high. movable panels of floor-to-ceiling maps and charts are crammed with intelligence information. and bill wisman , forty-three , a farmer's son from beallsville , ohio , is a quiet but impressive man. his eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown. his movements and speech are precise , clear and quick. no question ruffles him or causes him to hesitate. wisman , who has had the chief controller's job for four years , calls the signals for a team operating three rows of dull-gray consoles studded with lights , switches and buttons. at least a dozen men , some armed , are never far away from him. in front of him is a gold phone. in emergencies the sac commander , gen. thomas power , or his deputies and their staff would occupy a balcony that stretches across the length of the room above wisman and his staff. at general power's seat in the balcony there is also a gold phone. general power would participate in the decision making. wisman , below , would listen in and act. his consoles can give him instant contact with more than seventy bases around the world and with every sac aircraft. he need only pick up one of the two red telephone receivers at his extreme left , right next to the big red button marked alert. there are two receivers in case one should be dropped and damaged. but wisman , too , does not know the go code. he must take it from " the red box "". in point of fact , this is a beige box with a bright red door , about one and a half feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to wisman's right. the box is internally wired so the door can never be opened without setting off a screeching klaxon " it's real obnoxious "". now we must become vague , for we are approaching one of the nation's most guarded secrets. the codes in the red box there are several of them covering various contingencies are contained in a sealed x-ray-proof " unique device "". they are supplied , a batch at a time , by a secret source and are continually changed by wisman or his staff , at random intervals. but even the contents of wisman's box cannot start a war. they are mere fragments , just one portion of preprepared messages. what these fragments are and how they activate the go order may not be revealed. the pieces must be placed in the context of the prepared messages by wisman's staff. in addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures which precede and follow the sending of the go messages , again in special codes , each message also contains an " internal authenticator "" , another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting the real thing. i asked wisman what would happen if he broke out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one. " i'd wind up full of bullet holes "" , he said , and there was no question that he was talking about bullets fired by his coworkers. now let us imagine a wing of b-52's , on alert near their " positive control or fail-safe points "" , the spots on the map , many miles from soviet territory , beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific orders to proceed to their targets. they , too , have fragments of the go code with them. as wisman put it , " they have separate pieces of the pie , and we have the whole pie. once we send out the whole pie , they can put their pieces into it. unless we send out the whole pie , their pieces mean nothing "". why does wisman's ever-changing code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers ? ? the answer is a cryptographic secret. at any rate , three men out of a six-man b-52 crew are required to copy down wisman's go-to-war message. each must match wisman's " pie "" with the fragment that he carries with him. all three must compare notes and agree to " go "". after that , it requires several minutes of concentrated work , including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum of three men sitting at three separate stations in a bomber , each with another man beside him to help , for an armed bomb to be released. unless all gadgets are properly operated and the wires and seals from the handles removed first no damage can be done.

the following items may be specified in actual or symbolic form in the operands of those instructions which refer to the particular items : channel , unit , combined channel and unit , combined arm and file , unit record synchronizers , inquiry synchronizers , and alteration switches. the declarative operation equ is used to equate symbolic names to item numbers see page 85. continuation cards certain autocoder statements make provision for more parameters than may be contained in the operand columns 21 - 75 of a single line on the autocoder coding sheet. when this is the case , the appropriate section of this manual will indicate that " continuation cards "" may be used. thus , when specifically permitted , the operand of a given line on the autocoder coding sheet may be continued in the operand of from one to four additional lines which immediately follow. the label and operation columns must be blank and the continuation of the operand must begin in column 21 ; ; i.e. , it must be left-justified in the operand column of the coding sheet. the operand need not extend across the entire operand column of either the header card or continuation cards but may end with the comma following any parameter. remarks may appear to the right of the last parameter on each card provided they are separated from the operand by at least two blank spaces. illustrations of the use of continuation cards are included throughout the examples illustrating the various statements. if a continuation card follows a statement that does not permit continuation cards , the compiler will generate a nop and issue an error message. additional restrictions regarding the use of continuation cards with macro-instructions appear on page 106. reservation of index words and electronic switches the assignment of actual addresses to symbolic index word and electronic switch names occurs in phase 3 , of the autocoder processor. the initial availability of index words and electronic switches is determined by a table which is included in the compiler systems tape. this table originally indicates that index words 1 through 96 and electronic switches 1 through 30 are available for assignment to symbolic references ; ; index words 97 through 99 are not available. the initial setting of this table may be altered , however , as described in the 7070/7074 data processing system bulletin " ibm 7070/7074 compiler system : operating procedure "" , form aj. during the first pass of phase 3 , , references to the actual addresses of index words and electronic switches are collected and the availability table is updated. at the end of this pass , the table indicates which index words and electronic switches are not available for assignment to symbolic references. both index words and electronic switches may have been made unavailable before the start of assignment in one of the following ways. 1. the initial setting of the availability table indicated that the index word or electronic switch was not available for assignment. 2. the one- or two-digit number of the index word or electronic switch was used in the operand of a symbolic machine instruction to specify indexing or as a parameter which is always an index word or electronic switch , e.g. , 3. the one- or two-digit number of the index word or electronic switch was used in the operand of an equ statement , e.g. , when the index words or electronic switches are reserved because of actual usage in the statements described above , the position or order of the statements within the program is not important ; ; any such reference will make the index word or electronic switch unavailable at the end of this pass. during the assignment pass of phase 3 , , index words and electronic switches are reserved as they are encountered during assignment. index words and electronic switches may be reserved in the following ways. the first two methods apply to both index words and electronic switches ; ; the third applies only to index words. 1. during the assignment pass , each instruction is examined for reference to the symbolic name of an index word or electronic switch. when such a reference is found , an actual address is assigned and the availability table is changed so that the assigned index word or switch is no longer available for later assignment. 2. if the one- or two-digit address of an index word or electronic switch is used or is included in the operand of an xreserve or sreserve statement see page 99 , the corresponding index word or electronic switch is reserved. 3. if a statement has been assigned an address in the index word area by means of an actual label or by means of an origin statement which refers to an actual address , the corresponding index word will be reserved. these entries should normally appear at the beginning of the program or immediately following each litorigin statement. otherwise , symbolic names may have previously been assigned to these same index words. this method does not apply to electronic switches. the preceding methods allow efficient use of index words and electronic switches during a sectionalized or multi-phase program , particularly when used in conjunction with the litorigin statement. extreme caution should be used , however , to avoid the conflicting usage of an index word or electronic switch which may result from the assignment of more than one name or function to the same address. if the symbolic name or actual address of an index word or electronic switch appears or is included in the operand of an xrelease or srelease statement see page 101 , the specified index word or electronic switch will again be made available , regardless of the method by which it was reserved. it will not , however , be used for symbolic assignment until all other index words or electronic switches have been assigned for the first time. if , at any time during the assignment pass , the compiler finds that there are no more index words available for assignment , the warning message " no more index words available "" will be placed in the object program listing , the table will be altered to show that index words 1 through 96 are available , and the assignment will continue as before. if the compiler finds that there are no more electronic switches available for assignment , the warning message " no more electronic switches available "" will be placed in the object program listing , the table will be altered to show that electronic switches 1 through 30 are available , and assignment will continue as before. the resultant conflicting usage of index words or electronic switches may be avoided by reducing the number of symbolic names used , e.g. , through the proper use of the equ , xrelease , or srelease statements. as noted in appendix c , index words 97 through 99 are never available for assignment to symbolic names by the compiler ; ; also , index words 93 through 96 may have been made unavailable for assignment. declarative statements autocoder declarative statements provide the processor with the necessary information to complete the imperative operations properly. declarative statements are never executed in the object program and should be separated from the program instruction area , placed preferably at its beginning or end. otherwise , special care must be taken to branch around them so that the program will not attempt to execute something in a data area as an instruction. if the compiler does encounter such statements , a warning message will be issued. 7070/7074 autocoder includes the following declarative statements : da define area , dc define constant , drdw define record definition word , dsw define switch , dline define line , equ equate , code,dtf define tape file , diocs define input/output control system , and duf descriptive entry for unit records. da , dc , dtf , and dline require more than one entry. the da statement is used to name and define the positions and length of fields within an area. the dc statement is used to name and enter constants into the object program. since the 7070 and 7074 make use of record definition words rdws to read , write , move , and otherwise examine blocks of storage , the da and dc statements provide the option of generating rdws automatically. when so instructed , autocoder will generate one or more rdws and assign them successive locations immediately preceding the area with which they are to be associated. an rdw will be of the form af , where xxxx is the starting location of the area and yyyy is its ending location. these addresses are calculated automatically by the processor. in some cases , it may be more advantageous to assign locations to rdws associated with da and dc areas in some other part of storage , i.e. , not immediately preceding the da or dc areas. the drdw statement may be used for this purpose. the drdw statement may also be used to generate an rdw defining any area specified by the programmer. as many as ten digital switches may be named and provided by the dsw statement for consideration by the setsw and logic macro-instructions. each switch occupies one digit position in a word , can be set on or off , and is considered as logically equivalent to an electronic switch. it cannot , however , be referred to by electronic switch commands , e.g. , esn , bsn , etc.. an individual switch or the entire set of switches in a word may be tested or altered as desired. through use of the dline statement , a means is provided for specifying both the editing of fields to be inserted in a print line area and the layout of the area itself. the area may include constant information supplied by the programmer. the area may also be provided with additional data during the running of the object program by means of edmov or move macro-instructions. the declarative statement equ permits the programmer to equate symbolic names to actual index words , electronic switches , arm and file numbers , tape channel and unit numbers , alteration switches , etc. , and to equate a symbol to another symbol or to an actual address. the diocs , dtf , and duf statements are used when required by the input/output control system. diocs is used to select the major methods of processing to be used , and to name the index words used by aj. each tape file must be described by tape file specifications , produced by aj. in addition to information related to the file and its records , the file specifications contain subroutine locations and the location of tape label information. a duf entry must be supplied for every unit record file describing the type of file and the unit record equipment to be used. the duf also supplies the locations of subroutines written by the user that are unique to the file. a full description of the diocs , dtf , and duf statements is contained in the 7070 data processing system bulletin " ibm 7070 input/output control system "" , form aj. brief descriptions of these three declarative statements and detailed descriptions of the formats and functions of each of the other 7070/7074 autocoder declarative statements follow below. diocs define input/output control system when the input/output control system is to be used in a program , a diocs statement must be used to select the major methods of processing to be used. this statement also allows the naming of the index words used by aj. source program format the basic format of the diocs statement is as follows : anylabel is any symbolic label ; ; it may be omitted. the entry diocs must be written exactly as shown. the first item in the operand , iocsixf , is used to specify the first iocs index word for programs using tape files. this item may be a symbolic name or an actual one-digit or two-digit index word address in the range 3 - 94. if the first item in the operand is omitted , the symbolic name iocsixf will be assigned. when an actual index word or a symbolic address is specified , autocoder will equate the name iocsixf to it. the second item in the operand , iocsixg , is used to specify the second iocs index word for programs using tape files. this item may be a symbolic name or an actual one-digit or two-digit index word address in the range 3 - 94. if the second item in the operand is omitted , the symbolic name iocsixg will be assigned. when an actual index word or a symbolic address is specified , autocoder will equate iocsixg to it.

" so it was not the earthquake that made him return to his village "" ! ! " no. now dammit , i do not want to go into any more explanations. here comes jason. keep this to yourself "". reverend jason , looking worried , hurried toward us. " anything wrong , cap'n ? ? the men seem to think so "". " dirion found a large war party south of us. they'll probably attack at dawn "" , montero said. he brushed past the clergyman and walked into the center of the camp. using his hands as a trumpet he shouted , " fort up ! ! fort up ! ! there is a large war party on their way "" ! ! for a second , engages , cooks , voyageurs appeared struck dumb. then little billy began shouting orders to round up the ponies and fill the water buckets and for the cooks to hurry up with the meal. they all flew into action. " that was a terrible thing to do "" , i said to oso. the aricaras treated us like friends. and here all the time you knew the sioux would be using our rifles on them ! ! god , what a world you people live in "". oso gave me an unruffled look. " old knife's got the largest war party ever seen on the river "" , he said calmly. " what would you have done in montero's moccasins ? ? let old knife come up and kill you and your people , or would you steer him on someone else "" ? ? he shook his head. " mr. manuel did that in the war. that is why the british never got the tribes to fight for the king. mr. manuel whispered in the ears of the sioux that the cheyennes were comin" to raid "em for their horses. then he went on to the cheyennes and told them that the sioux was goin" to move up. he did that with all the nations. hell , they were fightin" each other so hard they had no time for anyone else. the war department wrote mr. manuel a letter and said he was a hero. i saw that letter. he carried it in a little wallet made of fish skin "". " but that was war "" , i said. " there is no war on now "". " you are wrong , matt. in this country there is a war on every time the grass turns green. first it was the nations against themselves , then it was them against the whites. and it's goin" to go on like this year after year until the white people take over this land "". i remember being told it would happen so fast people would think it took place overnight. " that is why this company's important. once we get over the mountains others will come along. that is why the trust do not want us to make it. that bastard chambers ! ! old knife's not the only chief he'll get to do his dirty work ! ! before we get through he'll have the blackfeet hankerin" for our hair and our goods. well , talkin" ain't goin" to help let's fort up "" ! ! as i dug in behind one of the bales we were using as protection , i grudgingly found myself agreeing with oso's logic , especially when i imagined what would have happened to missy if old knife's large party of screeching warriors had overrun our company. for , unlike the sioux and the crows , the aricaras are not great horsemen , nor are they aggressive like the savage blackfeet. more of an agricultural nation , they have relied on their warriors only for defense and for survival in the endless wars of the plains. still , i was disgusted with myself for agreeing with montero's methods. surprisingly , he had told the others what he had done. in the brief moment i had to talk to them before i took my post on the ring of defenses , i indicated i was sickened by the methods men employed to live and trade on the river. " i think montero did right "" , amy said firmly. " let the savages kill each other. what do we care "" ? ? reverend jason was understandably bitter. " it was a terrible thing to do. those little children. "" but oso replied calmly , " trouble ain't easy to dodge out in this country , rev'rend "". 28. attack gray eyes attacked our camp just as the first pink threads stitched together the hills and the sky. our camp was in the center of a wide valley. montero had set up a strong position , using every bale and box we had in addition to barricades of logs and brush. he had ordered the ponies brought inside the fortified circle and had assigned pierre and a band of picked engages the job of trying to keep them steady under fire. the pony herd was the one flaw in our defense ; ; the rees undoubtedly would try to cut down as many of the animals as possible. wildly bucking horses would make the position difficult to defend against charging warriors. the cooks had prepared one of the best meals we'd had in a long time , and on montero's orders had baked enough bread to last the day. buckets were filled , the herd fed and watered. the worst part had been the waiting ; ; although we did not expect the attack before dawn , the long cloudy night , filled with the sounds of the industrious insects , seemed endless. coyotes and hunting wolves sounded like signaling indian scouts , the whinny of a restless pony made one's skin crawl. oso slept unconcernedly , his rifle cradled in his arms ; ; i did not catch a wink. every time i closed my eyes , i saw gray eyes rushing at me with a knife. it was a relief when they finally came. they poured through the opening in the valley , then spread out in a long line to come at us , brandishing their lances and filling the morning with their spine-chilling scalp cry. " oso "" , montero called " i'll get gray eyes "". " that'll be a pleasure to see "" , the big black murmured as he stared down the barrel of his rifle. " hold your fire "" , montero was shouting. " wait until my shot. i'll shoot the first man who does not "". i could see them in my sights. they were about a mile off ; ; under me the ground quivered slightly. at first they were only feathers and dark indistinguishable faces and bodies , hunched over their horses" heads. gradually they emerged as men. gray eyes was in the lead. his face was split by a vermilion streak , his eyes were pools of white ; ; jagged red and black medicine symbols covered his chest. he was naked except for a clout. next to him was a young boy i was sure had sat near me at one of the trading sessions. his mouth was open , his neck corded with the strain of his screams. i found his chest in my sights. it had a red circle. the circle came nearer and nearer. my god , how long is he going to wait , i thought. montero's rifle cracked. at first i thought he had missed. gray eyes remained erect. the feathered lance was still above his head. as he started to slump over , another warrior swung him onto his horse. i squeezed the trigger. at the last second i dropped my sights from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony. i saw the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior flew over its head , bouncing like a rubber ball. he started to run but oso's shot caught him on the wing. he jerked once in the grass and lay still. " if you are goin" to kill "em ! ! kill "em "" ! ! oso growled. what else he said was lost in the rattle of gunfire on all sides. the aricaras broke under the devastating fire , wheeled and retreated. " lead up ! ! lead up ! ! they'll be back "" ! ! montero was shouting. far up the valley i could see the rees circling and reorganizing. out in front of our walls the grass was covered with dead and dying men , war shields , lances , blankets and wounded and dead horses. the morning air was filled with the sweetish odor of new-spilled blood , the acrid stench of frightened horses , and the bitterness of burned powder. a horse screamed as it twisted from side to side in a frenzy. a rifle cracked ; ; the square head fell over. one of the warriors suddenly leaped to his feet and began running across the valley to the trees that lined the small creek. his legs pumped furiously , his long black hair streamed out behind him. there was a ragged volley. he was dead before he hit the ground. " for christ's sake , do not waste your powder on one of "em "" ! ! montero shouted furiously. " wait for the charge ! ! the charge , i tell you "" ! ! the sharp cries at the end of the valley were faint. they grew louder as the indians charged again. i could see their faces glistening with sweat and bear grease , their mouths open , shouting their spine-chilling cries. " gray eyes is back , , montero said. the war captain had been badly wounded and was fighting to hold his seat. i could see the blood running down his chest. he was riding between two warriors , who held him erect when he started to slump. i forgot to aim. in my sights i watched him looming bigger and bigger. montero's shot had caught him high in the chest ; ; there was no doubt he was dying. again we waited for montero. this time he delayed so long that some of the engages shouted frantically , but they held their fire. the horses were only several lengths away when he fired. the bullet flung gray eyes from his horse. our rolling volley swept most of the other riders from their mounts. but a few reached our wall. i heard the whir of an ax and a canadian's face burst apart in a bloody spray. i saw little billy rise and fire almost point blank and an indian's face became shattered flesh and bone. a second leaped from his horse to the top of the bale , firing four arrows in such rapid succession it did not seem possible they were in flight. men screamed. oso reached up , jerked the buck from the bale and snapped his neck. other indians were running at the ponies , shrilling and waving blankets. reverend jason got one , the canadians the others. i saw the clergyman kneel for a moment by the twitching body of the man he had shot , then run back to his position. the ponies were almost uncontrollable. the pall of dust they raised made it difficult to see when the aricaras charged again. this time more of them hurdled the barrier. a small indian dived at montero , who caught him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle butt. it sounded like a man kicking a melon. above me a dark rider was whipping his pony with a quirt in an attempt to hurdle the bales. although my shot killed his horse , he rolled off the bale on top of me. i could smell woodsmoke , grease , and oil. his eyes were dark , fluid , fearful , and he gave a sigh as my knife went in. coming over the wall he had seemed like a hideous devil. now under me i could see him for what he really was , a boy dressed up in streaks of paint. the aricaras made one last desperate charge. it was pitiful to see the thin ranks of warriors , old and young , wheeling and twisting their ponies frantically from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding from their saddles by the relentless slam , slam of the cruelly efficient hawkinses. others , badly wounded , gripped hands in manes , knees in bellies , held on as long as possible and then , weak from ghastly wounds , slipped sideways , slowly , almost thoughtfully , to be broken under the slashing hoofs. some gracefully soared from the backs of their wounded , screaming mounts to make one last defiant charge before the lead split their hearts or tore their guts. none of them reached our walls again. the few survivors grudgingly turned away. in the distance we could hear the drums and the wail of the death song.

all false gods resemble moloch , at least in the early phases of their careers , so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idol-worship to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice. but there is reason in all things , and in this country the heathenish cult of the motor-car is exceeding all bounds in its demands. the annual butchery of 40,000 american men , women and children to satiate its blood-lust is excessive ; ; a quota of 25,000 a year would be more than sufficient. no other popular idol is accorded even that much grace. if the railroads , for example , regularly slaughtered 25,000 passengers each year , the high priests of the cult would have cause to tremble for their personal safety , for such a holocaust would excite demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the united states. but by comparison with the railroad , the motor car is a relatively new object of popular worship , so it is too much to hope that it may be brought within the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily. yet it is plainly time to make a start , and to be effective the first move should be highly dramatic , without being fanatical. here , then , is what swift would have called a modest proposal by way of a beginning. from next new year's day let us keep careful account of each successive fatality on the highways , publicizing it on all media of communication. to avoid suspicion of bigotry , let the hand of vengeance be stayed until the meat-wagon has picked up the twenty-five thousandth corpse ; ; but let the twenty-five thousand and first butchery be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state highway commissioners. then let the whole lot be hanged in a public mass execution on july 4 , 1963. the scene , of course , should be nine miles northwest of centralia , illinois , the geographical center of population according to the census. a special grandstand , protected by awnings from the midsummer sun of illinois , should be erected for occupancy by honored guests , who should include the ambassadors of all those new african nations as yet not quite convinced that the united states is thoroughly civilized. the band should play the rogues" march as a processional , switching to " hail columbia , happy land "" ! ! as the trap is sprung. independence day is the appropriate date as a symbolical reminder of the american article of faith that governments are instituted among men to secure to them certain inalienable rights , the first of which is life , and when any government becomes subversive of that end , it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it. the highway system is an agency of government , and when it grinds up 40,000 americans every year the government is destroying its own taxpayers , which is obviously a silly thing for any government to do. hanging the responsible officials would not abolish the government , but would emphasize its accountability for the lives of its individual citizens , which would certainly alter it , and definitely for the better. moreover , the salubrious effects would not be exclusively political , but at least partially , and perhaps primarily social. it would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some of its ancillary beliefs and practices for instance , the doctrine that the fulfillment of life consists in proceeding from hither to yon , not for any advantage to be gained by arrival but merely to avoid the cardinal sin of stasis , or , as it is generally termed , staying put. true , the adherents of staying put are now reduced to a minor , even a miniscule sect , and their credo , " home-keeping hearts are happiest "" , is as disreputable as socinianism. nonetheless , although few in number they are a stubborn crew , as tenacious of life as the hardshell baptists , which suggests that there is some kind of vital principle embodied in their faith. perhaps there is more truth than we are wont to admit in the conviction of that ornament of tarheelia , robert ruark's grandfather , who was persuaded that the great curse of the modern world is " all this gallivantin" "". in any event , the yearly sacrifice of 40,000 victims is a hecatomb too large to be justified by the most ardent faith. somehow our contemporary moloch must be induced to see reason. since appeals to morality , to humanity , and to sanity have had such small effect , perhaps our last recourse is the deterrent example. if we make it established custom that whenever butchery on the highways grows excessive , say beyond 25,000 per annum , then somebody is going to hang , it follows that the more eminent the victim , the more impressive the lesson. to hang 50 governors might be preferable except that they are not directly related to the highways ; ; so , all things considered , the highway commissioners would seem to be elected. as the new clouds of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly around the earth , the soviet union stands guilty of a monstrous crime against the human race. but the guilt is shared by the united states , britain and france , the other members of the atomic club. until moscow resumed nuclear testing last september 1 , the us and uk had released more than twice as much radiation into the atmosphere as the russians , and the fallout from the earlier blasts is still coming down. as it descends , the concentration of radioactivity builds up in the human body ; ; for a dose of radiation is not like a flu virus which causes temporary discomfort and then dies. the effect of radiation is cumulative over the years and on to succeeding generations. so , while we properly inveigh against the new poisoning , history is not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the west were so quick to assume when mr. khrushchev made his cynical and irresponsible threat. shock , dismay and foreboding for future generations were legitimate reactions ; ; a holier-than-thou sermon was not. on october 19 , after the soviets had detonated at least 20 nuclear devices , ambassador stevenson warned the un general assembly that this country , in " self protection "" , might have to resume above-ground tests. more recently , the chairman of the atomic energy commission , dr. glenn t. seaborg , " admitted "" to a news conference in las vegas , nevada , that the us might fall behind russia he apparently meant in weapons development if the soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain. the trial balloons are afloat. all of which makes it more imperative than ever that the biological and genetic effects of fallout be understood. but for the average citizen , unfortunately , this is one of science's worst-marked channels , full of tricky currents and unknown depths. the scientists , in and out of government , do not agree on some of the most vital points , at least publicly. on the one hand , the public health service declared as recently as october 26 that present radiation levels resulting from the soviet shots " do not warrant undue public concern "" or any action to limit the intake of radioactive substances by individuals or large population groups anywhere in the aj. but the phs conceded that the new radioactive particles " will add to the risk of genetic effects in succeeding generations , and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the united states "". then it added : " it is not possible to determine how extensive these ill effects will be nor how many people will be affected "". having hedged its bets in this way , phs apparently decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination after all : " at present radiation levels , and even at somewhat higher levels , the additional risk is slight and very few people will be affected "". then , to conclude on an indeterminate note : " nevertheless , if fallout increased substantially , or remained high for a long time , it would become far more important as a potential health hazard in this country and throughout the world "". dr. linus pauling , a nobel prize winner in chemistry , has been less ambiguous , whether you choose to agree with him or not. after declaring , in an article last month in frontier magazine , that the russian testing " carries with it the possibility of the most tragic consequences of any action in the history of the world "" , he gave this estimate of the biologic and genetic consequences if the new soviet shots totaled 200 megatons : the damage to human germ plasm would be such that in the next few generations 160,000 children around the world would be born with gross physical or mental defects. long-lived carbon-14 from the fusion process would cause four million embryonic , neonatal or childhood deaths and stillbirths over the next 20 generations , and between 200,000 and one million human beings now living would have their lives cut short by radiation-produced diseases such as leukemia. most of these would be in the northern hemisphere , where the fallout is concentrating. pauling's estimate of 200 megatons yield from the present series of russian tests will probably turn out to be too high , but a total of 100 megatons is a distinct possibility. the lack of scientific unanimity on the effects of radiation is due in part to insufficient data covering large population groups , from which agreed-on generalizations could be drawn. but more than one conscientious researcher has been inhibited from completely frank discussion of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout has been made a political issue as well as a scientific problem. its dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe national security requires further testing. an illustration of this attitude is found in john a. mccone's letter to dr. thomas lauritsen , reported in a note elsewhere in this issue of the new republic. to this day the atomic energy commission shies away from discussing the health aspects of fallout. a recent study on radiation exposure by the aec's division of biology and medicine stated : " the question of the biological effect of radiation doses is not considered "" herein. of course , the aec is in a bind now. if it comes down too hard on the potential dangers of fallout , it will box the president on resuming atmospheric tests. so the commission's announcements of the new soviet shots have been confined to one or two bleak sentences , with the fission yield usually left vague. now , of course , that the russians are the nuclear villains , radiation is a nastier word than it was in the mid , when the us was testing in the atmosphere. the prevailing official attitude then seemed to be that fallout , if not exactly good for you , might not be much worse than a bad cold. after a nuclear blast , one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days , about all you had to do was haul out the broom and sweep off your sidewalks and roof. things are not that simple anymore. yet if washington gets too indignant about soviet fallout , it will have to do a lot of fast footwork if america decides it too must start pushing up the radiation count. how much fallout will we get ? ? as of october 25 , the aec had reported 24 shots in the new soviet series , 12 of them in a megaton range , including a super bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 megatons the equivalent of 30 million to 50 million tons of tnt ; ; and president kennedy indicated there were one or two more than those reported. assuming the lower figure for the big blast and one shot estimated by the japanese at 10 megatons , a conservative computation is that the 24 announced tests produced a total yield of at least 60 megatons. some government scientists say privately that the figure probably is closer to 80 megatons , and that the full 50-megaton bomb that khrushchev mentioned may still be detonated. if the new soviet series has followed the general pattern of previous russian tests , the shots were roughly half fission and half fusion , meaning a fission yield of 30 to 40 megatons thus far. to this must be added the 90 to 92 megatons of fission yield produced between the dawn of the atomic age in 1945 and the informal three-power test moratorium that began in november , 1958.

does our society have a runaway , uncontrollable growth of technology which may end our civilization , or a normal , healthy growth ? ? here there may be an analogy with cancer : we can detect cancers by their rapidly accelerating growth , determinable only when related to the more normal rate of healthy growth. should the accelerating growth of technology then warn us ? ? noting such evidence is the first step ; ; and almost the only " cure "" is early detection and removal. one way to determine whether we have so dangerous a technology would be to check the strength of our society's organs to see if their functioning is as healthy as before. so an objective look at our present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous situation. in any event , whether society may have cancer , or merely a virus infection , the " disease "" , we shall find , is political , economical , social , and even medical. have not our physical abilities already deteriorated because of the more sedentary lives we are now living ? ? hence the prime issue , as i see it , is whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind , or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible with its own needs as a force of nature. we are already committed to establishing man's supremacy over nature and everywhere on earth , not merely in the limited social-political-economical context we are fond of today. otherwise , we go on endlessly trying to draw the line , color and other , as to which kind of man we wish to see dominate. we have proved so able to solve technological problems that to contend we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted , if nothing else. we must believe we have the ability to affect our own destinies : otherwise why try anything ? ? so in these pages the term " technology "" is used to include any and all means which could amplify , project , or augment man's control over himself and over other men. naturally this includes all communication forms , e.g. languages , or any social , political , economic or religious structures employed for such control. properly mindful of all the cultures in existence today throughout the world , we must employ these resources without war or violent revolution. if we were creating a wholly new society , we could insist that our social , political , economic and philosophic institutions foster rather than hamper man ; ; best growth. but we cannot start off with a clean slate. so we must first analyze our present institutions with respect to the effect of each on man's major needs. asked which institution most needs correction , i would say the corporation as it exists in america today. at first glance this appears strange : of all people , was not america founded by rugged individualists who established a new way of life still inspiring " undeveloped "" societies abroad ? ? but hear harrison e. salisbury , former moscow correspondent of the new york times , and author of " to moscow and beyond "". in a book review of " the soviet cultural offensive "" , he says , " long before the state department organized its bureaucracy into an east-west contacts staff in order to wage a cultural counter-offensive within soviet borders , the sharp cutting-edge of american culture had carved its mark across the russian steppes , as when the enterprising promoters of " porgy and bess " overrode the state department to carry the contemporary " cultural warfare " behind the enemy lines. they were not diplomats or jazz musicians , or even organizers of reading-rooms and photo-montage displays , but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs like henry ford , hugh cooper , thomas campbell , the international harvester co. , and david w. griffith. their kind created an american culture superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture which penetrated russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies. this favorable image of america in the minds of russian men and women is still there despite years of energetic anti-american propaganda "" corporations now outmoded. perhaps the public's present attitude toward business stems from the fact that the " rugged capitalist entrepreneur "" no more exists in america. in his stead is a milquetoast version known as " the corporation "". but even if we cannot see the repulsive characteristics in this new image of america , foreigners can ; ; and our loss of " prestige "" abroad is the direct result. no amount of ballyhoo will cover up the sordid facts. if we want respect from ourselves or others , we will have to earn it. first , let us realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times , now the corporation per se cannot take economic leadership. businesses must develop as a result of the ideas , energies and ambitions of an individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind. when we " forced "" individuals to assume the corporate structure by means of taxes and other legal statutes , we adopted what i would term " pseudo-capitalism "" and so took a major step toward socialism. the biggest loss , of course , was the individual's lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy. socialism , i grant , has a definite place in our society. but let us not complain of the evils of capitalism by referring to a form that is not truly capitalistic. some forms of capitalism do indeed work superb organizations , a credit to any society. but the pseudo-capitalism which dictates our whole economy as well as our politics and social life , will not stand close scrutiny. its pretense to operate in the public interest is little more than a sham. it serves only its own stockholders and poorly at that. as a creative enterprise , its abilities are primarily in " swallowing "" creative enterprises developed outside its own organization an ability made possible by us , and almost mandatory. as to benefits to employees , it is notorious for its callous disregard except where it depends on them for services. the corporation in america is in reality our form of socialism , vying in a sense with the other socialistic form that has emerged within governmental bureaucracy. but while the corporation has all the disadvantages of the socialist form of organization so cumbersome it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible with its need to perpetuate itself and maintain its status quo , unluckily it does not have the desirable aspect of socialism , the motivation to operate for the benefit of society as a whole. so we are faced with a vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever manner they can , without regard to the needs of society , controlling society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation's needs for survival. the corporation has a limited , specific place in our society. ideally speaking , it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply or services , and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society. examples are in public utilities , making military aircraft and accessories , or where the investment and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by any means other than the corporate form , e.g. constructing major airports or dams. thus , if corporations are not to run away with us , they must become quasi-governmental institutions , subject to public control and needs. in all other areas , private initiative of the " proprietorship "" type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services. proprietorship avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society ; ; and for this human beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests. such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can offer , corporations cannot. it can project long-range goals for itself. corporations react violently to short-range stimuli , e.g. , quarterly and annual dividend reports. proprietorships can establish a unity and integrity of control ; ; corporations , being more amorphous , cannot. proprietorships can establish a meaningful identity , representing a human personality , and thus establish sincere relationships with customers and community. corporations are apt by nature to be impersonal , inhumane , shortsighted and almost exclusively profit-motivated , a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public. the proprietor is able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate structure with its board of directors and stockholders. leadership is lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop. men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences of the most varied , complicated and trying type so that at maturation they have developed the competence and willingness to accept the personal responsibility so sorely needed now. hence government must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest. proprietorships should get the tax advantages now accruing to corporations , e.g. the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth. corporations should pay added taxes , to be used for educational purposes not necessarily of the formal type. the right to leave legacies should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated. to perpetuate wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no role in its creation prevents those with real initiative from coming to the fore , and is basically anti-democratic. when the proprietor dies , the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquired by another proprietor or the government decides to drop it. strikes should be declared illegal against corporations because disagreements would have to be settled by government representatives acting as controllers of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would now be defined against proprietorship because employees and proprietors must be completely interdependent , as they are each a part of the whole. strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship , if internally motivated , prevent a healthy relationship. certainly external forces should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to do so. if we cannot stop warfare in our own economic system , how can we expect to abolish it internationally ? ? one kind of proprietorship these proposals would go far toward creating the economic atmosphere favoring growth of the individual , who , in turn , would help us to cope with runaway technology. individual human strength is needed to pit against an inhuman condition. the battle is not easy. we are tempted to blame others for our problems rather than look them straight in the face and realize they are of our own making and possible of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed , enlightened , competent leaders. persons developed in today's corporations cannot hope to serve here a judgment based on experiences of my own in business and in activities outside. in my own company , in effect a partnership , although legally a corporation , i have been able to do many things for my employees which " normal "" corporations of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do. also , i am convinced that if my company were a sole proprietorship instead of a partnership , i would have been even abler to solve long-range problems for myself and my fellow-employees. any abilities i may have were achieved in their present shape from experience in sharing in the growth and control of my business , coupled with raising my family. this combined experience , on a foundation of very average , i assure you , intelligence and background , has helped me do things many well-informed people would bet heavily against. perhaps a list of some of the " practices "" of my company will help here. the company grew out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties , neither having a formal education applicable to , or experience in , manufacturing or selling our type of articles. from an initial investment of 1,200 in 1943 , it has grown , with no additional capital investment , to a present value estimated by some as exceeding 10,000,000 we do not disclose financial figures to the public. its growth continues steadily on a par with past growth ; ; and no limitation is in evidence. our pin-curl clips and self-locking nuts achieved dominance in just a few years time , despite substantial , well established competition.

the bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout. the pulmonary vein , however , without the limiting supportive tissue septa as in type 1 , , follows a more direct path to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship figs. 8 , 22. another marked difference is noted here. the pulmonary artery , in addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole , the alveolar duct , and the alveoli , continues on and directly supplies the thin pleura fig. 8. the bronchial artery , except for a small number of short branches in the hilum , contributes none of the pleural blood supply. it does , as in type 1 , , supply the hilar lymph nodes , the pulmonary artery , the pulmonary vein , the bronchi , and the bronchioles terminating in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole. no bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were noted in this group. lung type 3 fig. 3 is to some degree a composite of types 1 , and 2. it is characterized by the presence of incompletely developed secondary lobules ; ; well defined , but haphazardly arranged , interlobular septa and a thick , remarkably vascular pleura fig. 9. the most distal airways are similar to those found in type 1 , , being composed of numerous , apparently true terminal bronchioles and occasional , poorly developed respiratory bronchioles figs. 14 , 15. in this instance , because of incomplete septation , the secondary lobule does not constitute in itself what appears to be a small individual lung as in type 1. air-drifts from one area to another are , therefore , conceivable. distally the bronchus is situated between a pulmonary artery on one side and a pulmonary vein on the other , as in type 1 fig. 24. this relationship , however , is not maintained centrally. here the pulmonary vein , as in type 2 , , is noted to draw away from the bronchus , and to follow a more direct , independent course to the hilum figs. 23 , 24. the bronchial artery in its course and distribution differs somewhat from that found in other mammals. as seen in types 1 , and 2 , , it supplies the hilar lymph nodes , vasa vasorum to the pulmonary artery and vein , the bronchi and the terminal bronchioles. as in type 1 , , it provides arterial blood to the interlobular septa , and an extremely rich anastomotic pleural supply is seen figs. 9 , 10. this pleural supply is derived both from hilar and interlobular bronchial artery branches. such a dual derivation was strikingly demonstrated during the injection process where initial filling would be noted to occur in several isolated pleural vessels at once. some of these were obviously filling from interlobular branches of the bronchial arteries while others were filling from direct hilar branches following along the pleural surface. with completion of filling , net-like anastomoses were noted to be present between these separately derived branches. an unusual increase in the number of bronchial arteries present within the substance of the lung was noted. this was accounted for primarily by the presence of a bronchial artery closely following the pulmonary artery. the diameter of this bronchial artery was much too large for it to be a mere vasa vasorum figs. 16 , 23 , 24. in distal regions its diameter would be one-fourth to one-fifth that of the pulmonary artery. this vessel could be followed to the parenchyma where it directly provided bronchial arterial blood to the alveolar capillary bed figs. 17 , 18. also three other direct pathways of alveolar bronchial arterial supply were noted : via the pleura ; ; through the interlobular septa ; ; and along the terminal bronchiole figs. 14 , 17 , 18 , 19. one bronchial arteriolar-pulmonary arteriolar anastomosis was noted at the terminal bronchiolar level fig. 26. discussion it is evident that many marked and striking differences exist between lungs when an inter-species comparison is made. the significance of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence of corresponding physiologic differences been determined. however , the dynamics of airflow , from morphologic considerations alone , may conceivably be different in the monkey than in the horse. the volume and , perhaps , even the characteristics of bronchial arterial blood flow might be different in the dog than in the horse. also , interlobular air drifts may be all but nonexistent in the cow ; ; probably occur in the horse much as in the human being ; ; and , in contrast , are present to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where lobules are absent van allen and lindskog , "31. a reason for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology is entirely lacking at present. within certain wide limits anatomy dictates function and , if one is permitted to speculate , potential pathology should be included in this statement as well. for example , the marked susceptibility of the monkey to respiratory infection might be related to its delicate , long alveolar ducts and short , large bronchioles situated within a parenchyma entirely lacking in protective supportive tissue barriers such as those found in types 1 , and 3. one might also wonder if monkeys are capable of developing bronchiolitis as we know it in man or the horse. in addition , it would be difficult to imagine chronic generalized emphysema occurring in a cow , considering its marked lobular development but , conversely , not difficult to imagine this occurring in the horse or the dog. anatomically , the horse lung appears to be remarkably like that of man , insofar as this can be ascertained from comparison of our findings in the horse with those of others birnbaum , "54 in the human being. the only area in which one might find major disagreement in this matter is in regard to the alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries. as early as 1858 , le fort claimed an alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries in human beings. in 1951 , this was reaffirmed by cudkowicz. the opposition to this point of view has its staunchest support in the work of miller "50. apparently , however , miller has relied heavily on the anatomy in dogs and cats , and he has been criticized for using pathologic human material in his normal study loosli , "38. although miller noted in 1907 that a difference in the pleural blood supply existed between animals , nowhere in his published works is it found that he did a comparative study of the intrapulmonary features of various mammalian lungs other than in the dog and cat miller , "13 ; ; "25. the meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial artery as found in the horse is not clear. however , this artery is known to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal airways and supportive tissues of the lung. the alveoli and respiratory bronchioles are primarily diffusing tissues. theoretically , they are capable of extracting their required oxygen either from the surrounding air ghoreyeb and karsner , "13 or from pulmonary arterial blood comroe , "58. therefore , an explanation of this alveolar bronchial artery supply might be the nutritive requirement of an increased amount of supportive tissue , not primarily diffusing in nature , in the region of the alveolus. if this be true , the possibility exists that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial arteries might cause widespread degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that seen in generalized emphysema. one would not expect such an event to occur in animals possessing lungs of types 1 , or 2. the presence of normally occurring bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses was first noted in 1721 by ruysch , and thereafter by many others. nakamura "58 , verloop "48 , marchand , gilroy and watson "50 , von hayek "53 , and tobin "52 have all claimed their normal but relatively nonfunctional existence in the human being. miller "50 is the principal antagonist of this viewpoint. in criticism of the latter's views , his conclusions were based upon dog lung injection studies in which all of the vascular channels were first filled with a solution under pressure and then were injected with various sized colored particles designed to stop at the arteriolar level. as early as 1913 ghoreyeb and karsner demonstrated with perfusion studies in dogs that bronchial artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level when pressure was maintained in the pulmonary artery and vein , but that increases in bronchial artery flow would occur in response to a relative drop in pulmonary artery pressure. berry , brailsford and daly in 1931 and nakamura in 1958 reaffirmed this. our own studies in which bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were demonstrated , were accomplished by injecting the bronchial artery first with no pressure on the pulmonary artery or vein , and then by injecting the pulmonary artery and vein afterwards. it is distinctly possible , therefore , that simultaneous pressures in all three vessels would have rendered the shunts inoperable and hence , uninjectable. this viewpoint is further supported by verloop's "48 demonstration of thickened bronchial artery and arteriolar muscular coats which are capable of acting as valves. in other words , the anastomoses between the bronchial artery and pulmonary artery should be considered as functional or demand shunts. in addition , little work has been done on a comparative basis in regard to the normal existence of bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses. verloop "48 ; ; "49 found these shunts in the human being but was unable to find them in rats. ellis , grindlay and edwards "52 also were unable to find them in rats. nakamura "58 was unable to demonstrate their existence , either by anatomic or physiologic methods , in dogs. the possibility that the absence or presence of these shunts is species-dependent is therefore inferred. certainly , the mere fact of failing to demonstrate them in one or another species does not conclusively deny their existence in that species. it is , however , highly suggestive and agrees well with our own findings in which we also failed to demonstrate normally occurring bronchial artery-pulmonary artery shunts in certain species , especially the dog. in conclusion , these findings suggest the need for a comparative physiology , pathology , and histology of mammalian lungs. in addition , a detailed interspecies survey of the incidence of generalized pulmonary emphysema in mammals would be interesting and pertinent. also , for the present , great caution should be exercised in the choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary studies if they are to be applied to man. this is especially so if the dog , cat or monkey are to be used , in view of their marked anatomical differences from man. finally , it is suggested that in many respects the horse lung may be anatomically more comparable to that of the human than any other presently known species. summary the main subgross anatomical features of the lungs of various mammals are presented. a tabulation of these features permits the lungs to be grouped into three distinctive subgross types. type 1 , is represented by the cow , sheep , and pig ; ; type 2 , , by the dog , cat , and monkey ; ; type 3 , , by the horse. lobularity is extremely well developed in type 1 ; ; absent in type 2 ; ; imperfectly developed in type 3. the pleura and interlobular septa are thick in types 1 and 3. the pleura is extremely thin in type 2 and septa are absent. arterial supply to the pleura in types 1 and 3 is provided by the bronchial artery , and in type 2 , by the pulmonary artery. in types 1 , 2 and 3 the bronchial artery terminates in a capillary bed shared in common with the pulmonary artery at the level of the distal bronchiole. in type 3 the bronchial artery also provides blood directly to the alveolar capillary bed. true terminal bronchioles comprise the most frequent form taken by the distal airways in types 1 and 3 , although small numbers of poorly developed respiratory bronchioles are present. well developed respiratory bronchioles , on the other hand , appear to be the only form taken by the distal airways in type 2. in type 1 the pulmonary vein closely follows the course of the bronchus and the pulmonary artery from the periphery to the hilum. this may be due to the heavy interlobular connective tissue barriers present. in type 3 , this general relationship is maintained peripherally but not centrally where the pulmonary vein follows a more independent path to the hilum as is the case throughout the lung in type 2.

unimpressed , the dog plopped on the sand. quint could not blame maggie for disbelieving. for eleven days they'd done the same thing , leaving the cottage quietly before breakfast , before esperanza beach got jammed with tourists and beach balls and show-offy lifeguards. the swirling sand made quint's limp more pronounced. they walked slowly past the sherbet-colored cottages eleven lemon , nine mint , seven orange around the curve to a deserted stand with an " eats "" sign jiggling in the wind. now they were in friendly territory. nobody around. nothing but sand and a ridge of rocks sloping jaggedly to the water's edge. his rock was to the right of a v-shaped inlet , a big , brown , lumpy rock trailing seaweed whiskers. his rock was special because no one on the beach could see him here. here he was enclosed and safe. if a dragon or a sea monster came along , did not he have a red swiss hunting knife on his belt ten blades and a corkscrew ? ? here was a perfect place to lie down and make believe. he was canute controlling the waves. he was a knight of the round table , " sir quintus the brave "" , slaying evil spirits and banshees and vampires and witches with warty noses. one good thing about a suit of armor , his leg would not show. he was the first astronaut on the moon , chosen because of his small size and intrepid nature. he was six feet one like his father , with big hands and a hairy chest , a man the weak and persecuted would turn to. fearless. every night when he wanted a drink of water , did not he practice being fearless by not turning on the bathroom light ? ? a dark bathroom can be pretty scary , and he'd creep back to bed , proud of himself , thinking : tomorrow , for sure , i'll go down to the rock and keep my promise to dad. he had not intended to make the promise. it happened two weeks ago , the night before his father left on a business trip to south america. every piece of the nightmare was clear , in place ; ; and when he woke up , his father was saying , " stop screaming , quint. it's all right. stop shaking "". he could remember the feel of his father's big hands , the thump of his father's heart sending out signals regular , like radar. " let's talk about the beach. son. while i am gone you get brown and fat as a pig , hear ? ? look , i can put two fingers between the cords in the back of your neck. dr. fortman says swimming would help your leg. he says you are limping more than you need to "". " how does he know ? ? big dumb nut. he never had polio "". in the light from the bedside table his father looked so worried that the promise spilled out. " you just wait , dad. when you get back i'll probly be swimming better than victoria. wait and see , dad "". victoria was fourteen months younger than quint , a head taller , and could lick any boy or girl on the beach. he called her " fatso "". she called him " stuck-up that is why nobody plays with you , mister stuck-up "". or , what was worse , she prayed for him out loud at bedtime : " please , lord gord , please give my brother the strength to go swimming like he promised "". " she is got a nerve "". quint said now to the clouds. strength began to zip up and down his chest. he felt strong as a giant. he unlaced his high brown shoes and took off the metal brace on his leg. he wadded his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming trunks. " goolick , goooolick "" , creaked a sea gull. " aw , shut up "" , he said. he stood on the rock , a skinny , dignified boy surrounded by the ocean. the wind bored a hole between his shoulder blades , and when he looked at the choppy waves coming and going and crossing each other he could see his head down there , bleeding , wedged between the rocks and the waves. i cannot go in. i am scared of the nightmare. shivering , he put on his clothes. and shivering with shame , he crawled to the narrow end of the rock and spat into the water. " watch it , big shot "" , a hoarse voice yelled back. she was holding on to his rock with one hand. she smelled of peppermints. she wore a bathing suit like his mother's , no straps on the shouders. " why did not you duck "" ? ? he snapped. " this is my rock "". " is not "". " is "". " is not "". " is "". she was sore as a boil. " ever hear of squatter's rights "" ? ?

" you should not smoke so much "" , he said , unconsciously imitating victoria's holier-than-thou voice. " i do not smoke "". she was horrified. " do you "" ? ? " hell , yes "". not having said " hell "" before , he stumbled a bit before gathering momentum. " sometimes eleven , fourteen a day "". " if i was your mama , i'd wop your tail off "". " my mother never wops me. i have got this leg brace "". she seemed so unimpressed that he was obliged to roll up his blue jeans so she could see his brace. " dingy-looking "" , was what she said. " why do not you paint it red and white like a barber pole "" ? ? " because maybe i will not have to wear it always. dr. fortman says if i exercise my leg more , maybe i can use a cane when i am big "". she spouted a mouthful of water into the air. " a cane's mighty handy. someone's walking past , you want to stop him , zoooop , snag him around the neck with the crook in your cane. or say a waiter brings you a bowl of soup with a dead fly in it all you got to do is bannnnnng , stooooomp your cane on the floor. hey , will you look at that "" ? ? maggie had shaken himself awake and was licking the sand off his stubby whiskers and his long plume of a tail. " that is some dog. what kind "" ? ? " part collie , part wire-haired terrier "". quint glared. he always did when people asked. " holy mackerel , that is the most unique dog i ever saw "" , she said firmly.

" no. he is got a long beard and picks his teeth with a fork. my hair is what he is nuts about. naturally curly hair runs in my family. personally , i prefer straight hair like yours , but as they say on the continent , " what can one do " "" ? ?

" really "". quint smothered a yawn. she made better pictures than any book he'd read , but he did not say so. artfully , as the days went by , he found occasion to tell her that his father had won the navy cross in the korean war ; ; that his baby sister could spit up through her nose when she felt like it ; ; that he personally had an iq of 141 and was currently reading the mushr to ozon volume of the encyclopedia. " books are for schnooks "". she skipped a piece of water at him and laughed , a funny , hoarse laugh he liked to hear. nobody ever appreciated his jokes as much as sabella. " what did one tonsil say to the other tonsil ? ? let's get dressed up the doctor's taking us out tonight "". and " what time did the chinaman go to the dentist ? ? tooth-hurty "". encouraged by her giggles he imitated maggie who was crazy about ham. he described the ham decorated with pineapple and cherries , cooling on the porch. he snuck up on the ham like maggie , gumming it with soft , stumpy teeth , then panting with thirst , lapping up the water in the lagoon , swelling up like a balloon , staggering home to be sick , while his mother said , " that does it. that dog has to go "". " say , you are quite a comic "" , sabella said admiringly. " ever thought about going on the stage "" ? ? he had not. but it was such a nice thought that he nodded his head. " either that or a veterinarian "". " better make up your mind , son "" , sabella said. " you cannot serve cod and salmon "". sometimes they argued. she said sharks have no bones and shrimp swam backward. his encylopedia agreed with sabella. next morning he tied a bunch of sea daisies with string and threw them across the v-shaped inlet to the rock where she was swimming around. boy , could she catch ! ! like willie mays in the outfield. " nobody gave me flowers before. thank you , quint "". her face turned pink with pleasure and a smothered cough. " you can always tell a real gentleman they got a certain je ne say quok "". sometimes they did not talk at all. he daydreamed on the rock while she swam and splashed around. once when she asked why he never went swimming and he answered , " do not feel like it "" , he was tempted to tell her about being scared. but victoria began yodeling just then and he went home , carrying sabella in the back of his head , not thinking about her , just knowing she was there , smiling , smelling of peppermints. as for his promise oh , he had plenty of time , buckets of time. wednesday morning it happened. they were eating breakfast. " we beseech thee , lord gord , to bless this food "" that was victoria saying grace while the baby sprayed raisin toast on her plastic bib. same old breakfast till the phone rang , making his mother's voice shake with excitement. " your daddy's in san francisco "" , she told them. " he says he'll be here on the one-o'clock plane. fifteen days early is not that wonderful "" ? ?

temperature of the wash and rinse waters is maintained at 85 - 90-degrees-f 29 - 32-degrees-c. the top rolls are loaded with 40 lbs.. sixty lbs. loading is possible but 40 lbs. is adequate. the suds box drain is arranged at the start to deliver into the raised main drain pipe thus returning suds to soap box and the machine is started. the 160-ml. bath containing the calculated amount of detergent is applied slowly and directly to the running specimen. washing is continued for 30 minutes or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 nips or passes through the squeeze rolls. at the conclusion of the washing , 8 liters of water at 90-degrees-f 32 0c. are automatically metered from the rinse reservoir to the washing tubs , 4 liters to each tub. this operation requires from 10 to 12 minutes. during the rinsing operation the volume in the tubs gradually increases until overflow from the main drain begins. at this point the drains are readjusted so that the suds box drain will discharge directly into the waste line and the main tub drain is set at the 2-1/2 mark on the drain gauge. when all of the rinse water has passed from the reservoir to the tubs the main drains are lowered to permit complete draining of the tubs. the run is complete when all the water has drained off into the waste line. by this procedure rinsing progresses in two stages , first by dilution until the time when the drains are separated and thereafter by displacement of the soil-bearing liquor by clean rinse water , since soiled liquor squeezed from the specimens at the nip passes directly to waste from the suds box drains. this method of rinsing appears to produce maximum cleansing with minimum soil redeposition. suggested evaluation and classification evaluation may be made on either a soil-removal or a grease-removal basis as desired. a reflectance-measuring instrument may be desirable to measure cleaning , whereas soxhlet extraction is necessary to measure grease removal. purpose and scope this test method is intended for determining the dimensional changes of woven or knitted fabrics , made of fibers other than wool , to be expected when the cloth is subjected to laundering procedures commonly used in the commercial laundry and the home. four washing test procedures are established , varying in severity from very severe to very mild , and are intended to cover the range of practical washing from commercial procedure to hand washing. five drying test procedures are established to cover the range of drying techniques used in the home and commercial laundry. three methods for determining the dimensional restorability characteristics are established for those textiles which require restoration by ironing or wearing after laundering. these tests are not accelerated and must be repeated to evaluate dimensional changes after repeated launderings. table 1 , summarizes all of the various washing , drying , and restoration procedures available. the person using these tests must determine which combination of procedures is practical for any specific item in order to evaluate the dimensional changes of textile fabrics or garments after laundering procedures commonly used in the home or commercial laundry. it is possible to identify the test procedure completely with a code consisting of a roman numeral , a letter , and an arabic number. for example test 3 , e 1 refers to a specimen which has been washed by procedure " 3 "" at 160-degrees-f for a total of 60 minutes in the machine , has been dried in a tumble dryer by procedure " e "" and has been subjected to restorative forces on the tension presser by procedure " 1 "". principle a specimen or garment is washed in a cylindrical reversing wash wheel , dried and subjected to restorative forces where necessary. temperature and time of agitation in the wash wheel are varied to obtain different degrees of severity. drying procedures and application of restorative force procedures are varied to conform with end-use handling during home or commercial laundering. distances marked on the specimen in warp and filling directions or wales and courses for knitted fabrics are measured before and after laundering. apparatus and materials wash wheel cylindrical wash wheel of the reversing type. the wheel cage is 20 to 24 inches inside diameter and 20 to 24 inches inside length. there are three fins each approximately three inches wide extending the full length of the inside of the wheel. one fin is located every 120-degrees around the inside diameter of the wheel. the wash wheel rotates at a speed of 30 revolutions per minute , making five to ten revolutions before reversing. the water inlets are large enough to permit filling the wheel to an eight-inch level in less than two minutes , and the outlet is large enough to permit discharge of this same amount of water in less than two minutes. the machine is equipped with a pipe for injecting live steam that is capable of raising the temperature of water at an eight-inch level from 110-degrees to 140-degrees-f 38 0 to 60 0c. in less than two minutes. the machine shall contain an opening for the insertion of a thermometer or other equivalent equipment for determining the temperature of the water during the washing and rinsing procedures. it is equipped with an outside water gauge that will indicate the level of the water in the wheel. a domestic automatic washer that will give equivalent results may be used. the wash wheel is the equipment preferred for the test. pressing equipment flat-bed press measuring 24 inches by 50 inches or larger. any flat-bed press capable of pressing a specimen 22 inches square may be used as an alternative. the flat-bed press is maintained at a temperature not less than 275-degrees-f 135 0c.. dryer dryer of the rotary tumble type , having a cylindrical basket approximately 30 inches in diameter and 24 inches in length and rotating at approximately 35 r.p.m.. the dryer is provided with a means of maintaining a drying temperature of 120-degrees - 160-degrees-f 49 0 - 71 0c. , measured in the exhaust vent as close as possible to the drying chamber. screen drying racks 16-mesh

sodium metaphosphate or sodium hexametaphosphate if needed in hard water areas. detergent , synthetic alkylarysulfonate type. flatiron , electric approximately 3 lb. tension presser consisting of a padded ironing board from which extend clamping members on all four sides. two of the clamps are fixed to the edges of the board whereas two clamps travel on guide rails opposite the fixed clamps. the movable clamps travel on carriages which ride the rails and are drawn by dead-weight loading. sets of weights are provided so that the load can be selected in the range of 1/2 to 4 pounds. a perforated aluminum plate , used to provide the drying surface , is heated by means of a flatiron. a special template is furnished with the apparatus to enable marking a specimen for a central measuring area and the fabric extensions to the clamps see fig. 2. knit shrinkage gauge consisting of a set of 20 mounting pins set in guides in radial slots fig. 1. each pin is individually sprung to a tensioning member which is driven outwardly in the slot. the springs have an extension of 1 inch at af tension. the tensioning members have a common drive so that the application of restorative force takes place simultaneously in all directions in the plane of the test specimen. the minimum diameter of the pin frame in the collapsed state is 11 inches and the maximum diameter in the freely extended state unloaded is 14 inches. the surface of the apparatus in contact with the test specimen is uncluttered and polished so as to be as friction-free as possible. test specimens the preparation of test specimens will vary depending upon the type of dimensional restorability procedure if any to be used. three specimens for each sample to be tested are required in order to arrive at a satisfactory average of performance. this is especially true for knitted fabrics. specimens are allowed to reach moisture equilibrium with a standard atmosphere of af and af and then laid out without tension on a flat , polished surface , care being taken that the fabric is free from wrinkles or creases. fabrics that are badly distorted in their unlaundered state due to faulty finishing may give deceptive dimensional change results when laundered by any procedure. this also holds true if restorative forces are applied. therefore , it is recommended that in such cases the sample be replaced , or if used , the results of dimensional change or dimensional restorability tests be considered as indicative only. generally , it is necessary to mark distances on a specimen or garment in both lengthwise and widthwise directions and to measure before and after laundering. the distances may be marked with indelible ink and a fine-point pen , by sewing fine threads into the fabric , or by a specially designed stamping machine. the marked distances are parallel to the respective yarns. usually , the greater the original distances marked , the greater will be the accuracy of the test. distances of less than 10 inches are not recommended. woven fabrics to be dried by procedure b flat-bed pressed or restored by procedure 3 hand ironing : the specimen of fabric is a rectangle at least 22 by 22 inches , except for cloth narrower than 22 inches , in which case the specimen is the entire width of the fabric. three distances , each at least 18 inches , are measured and marked off parallel to each of the warp and filling directions. the distances are at least two inches from any edge of the specimen. woven or warp knitted fabrics to be subjected to restorative procedure 1 tension presser. each specimen is at least 25 inches by 25 inches. place the template fig. 2 on the fabric so that the sides of the 10 inch square cut out of the template are parallel to the warp and filling for woven fabrics , or the wales and courses for knitted fabrics , and so that the same amount of fabric extends beyond the edges of the template on all sides. mark the specimen at the outer edges of the template with pen and indelible ink ; ; also place three dots on the specimen at each side of the 10 inch square , one dot at midpoint , and one at approximately 1/2 inch from each corner. measure and record. circular knitted fabrics to be subjected to restorative procedure 2 , knit shrinkage gauge. each specimen is approximately 16 inches square. the markings consist of a

taken before and after washing , drying , and restorative procedures. procedure washing the washing procedures are summarized in table 2. place the specimen in the wash wheel with sufficient other similar fabric to make a dry load of af pounds. start the wash wheel and note the time. immediately add water at 100 - 105-degrees-f 38 - 43 0c. to the wheel to a level of af inches ; ; this level will be increased by condensed steam. when this water level has been reached , inject steam into the wheel until the temperature reaches that shown in column b of table 2. add sufficient soap and softener if required to counteract hard water to furnish a good running suds , or if desired use a synthetic detergent. test 1 , stop the wash wheel at the end of the time shown in column a of table 2

los angeles in 1957 finally bowed to the skyscraper. and without high density in the core , rapid-transit systems cannot be maintained economically , let alone built from scratch at today's prices. however , the building of freeways and garages cannot continue forever. the new interchange among the four los angeles freeways , including the grade-constructed accesses , occupies by itself no less than eighty acres of downtown land , one-eighth of a square mile , an area about the size of rockefeller center in new york. it is hard to believe that this mass of intertwined concrete constitutes what the law calls " the highest and best use "" of centrally located urban land. as it affects the city's fiscal situation , such an interchange is ruinous ; ; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services. subways improved land values without taking away land ; ; freeways boost valuation less because the garages they require are not prime buildings by a long shot , and reduce the acreage that can be taxed. downtown los angeles is already two-thirds freeway , interchange , street , parking lot and garage one of those preposterous " if "" statistics has already come to pass. the freeway with narrowly spaced interchanges concentrates and mitigates the access problem , but it also acts inevitably as an artificial , isolating boundary. city planners do not always use this boundary as effectively as they might. less ambitious freeway plans may be more successful especially when the roadways and interchanges are raised , allowing for cross access at many points and providing parking areas below the ramp. meanwhile , the automobile and its friend the truck have cost the central city some of its industrial dominance. in ever greater numbers , factories are locating in the suburbs or in " industrial parks "" removed from the city's political jurisdiction. the appeal of the suburb is particularly strong for heavy industry , which must move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly line and wants enough land area to do the entire job on one floor. to light industry , the economies of being on one floor are much slighter , but efficiency engineers usually believe in them , and manufacturers looking for ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning to efficiency engineers. this movement of industry away from the central cities is not so catastrophically new as some prophets seem to believe. it is merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which formed the pattern of virtually all american cities. the big factories which are relatively near the centers of our cities the rubber factories in akron , chrysler's detroit plants , u.s. steel's pittsburgh works often began on these sites at a time when that was the edge of the city , yet close to transport river , storage piers and power river. the " leapfrog "" was a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam turbine , and the time when the belts of residence surrounding the old factory area were not yet blighted. the truck and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree of freedom in selecting his plant site. until internal combustion became cheap , he had to be near a railroad siding and a trolley line or an existing large community of lower-class homes. the railroad siding is still important it is usually , though not always , true that long-haul shipment by rail is cheaper than trucking. but anybody who promises a substantial volume of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these days , and many businesses can live without the railroad. and there are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking lot , which can be reached by driving across or against the usual pattern of rush hour traffic and grille-route bus lines , is actually more convenient than the walk-to factory. willow run , general electric's enormous installations at louisville and syracuse , the pentagon , boeing in seattle , douglas and lockheed in los angeles , the new automobile assembly plants everywhere none of these is substantially served by any sort of conventional mass rapid transit. they are all suburban plants , relying on the roads to keep them supplied with workers. and wherever the new thruways go up their banks are lined by neat glass and metal and colored brick light industry. the drive along massachusetts" route 128 , the by-pass which makes an arc about twenty miles from downtown boston , may be a vision of the future. the future could be worse. the plants along route 128 are mostly well designed and nicely set against the new england rocks and trees. they can even be rather grand , like edward land's monument to the astonishing success of polaroid. but they deny the values of the city the crowded , competitive , tolerant city , the " melting pot "" which gave off so many of the most admirable american qualities. they are segregated businesses , combining again on one site the factory and the office , drawing their work force from segregated communities. it is interesting to note how many of the plants on massachusetts" route 128 draw most of their income either from the government in non-competitive cost-plus arrangements , or from the exploitation of patents which grant at least a partial monopoly. while the factories were always the center of the labor market , they were often on the city's periphery. in spreading the factories even farther , the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth pattern of the cities. even the loss of hotel business to the outskirt's motel has been relatively painless ; ; the hotel-motel demarcation is becoming harder to find every year. what hurts most is the damage the automobile has done to central-city retailing , especially in those cities where public transit is feeble. some retailing , of course , always spreads with the population grocery stores , drugstores , local haberdasheries and dress shops , candy stores and the like. but whenever a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago a new bedroom set or a winter coat , an easter bonnet , a bicycle for junior the family set off for the downtown department store , where the selection would be greatest. department stores congregated in the " one hundred per cent location "" , where all the transit lines converged. these stores are still there , but the volume of the " downtown store "" has been on a relative decline , while in many cities the suburban " branch "" sells more and more dry goods. if the retailer and hotelman's downtown unit sales have been decreasing , however , his dollar volume continues to rise , and it is dollars which you put in the bank. in most discussions of this phenomenon , the figures are substantially inflated. no suburban shopping-center branch not even hudson's vast northland outside detroit does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise to be found in the home store. telephone orders distort the picture : the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather than a central-city number if both are listed in an advertisement , especially if the local call eliminates city sales tax. the suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened. accounting procedures which continue to charge a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store make the branches seem more profitable than they are. in many cases that statement " we break even on our downtown operation and make money on our branches "" would be turned around if the cost analysis were recalculated on terms less prejudicial to the old store. fear of the competition always a great motivating force in the american economy makes retailers who do not have suburban operations exaggerate both the volume and the profitability of their rival's shiny new branches. the fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are uneconomical , that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important as it was downtown , and that even highly suburbanized cities will support only so many big branches. moreover , the cost of operations is always high in any new store , as the conservative bankers who act as controllers for retail giants are beginning to discover. when all has been said , however , the big branch store remains a major break with history in the development of american retailing. just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car , the trip to the shopping center may seem far easier than to the downtown department store , though both are the same distance from home. indeed , there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown. raymond vernon reports that residents of east st. louis have been driving across the mississippi , through the heart of downtown st. louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping , simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town. to the extent that the problem is merely parking , an aggressive downtown management , like that of lazarus brothers in columbus , ohio , can fight back successfully by building a garage on the lot next door. if the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened away from downtown by traffic problems , however , the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or await the completion of the federal highway program. and if the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with " nice people "" , rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports the downtown department store , the central location may be in serious trouble. today , according to land economist homer hoyt , shopping centers and their associated parking lots cover some 46,000 acres of land , which is almost exactly the total land area in all the nation's central business districts put together. the downtown store continues to offer the great inducement of variety , both within its gates and across the street , where other department stores are immediately convenient for the shopper who wants to see what is available before making up her mind. if anything may be predicted in the quicksilver world of retailing , it seems likely that the suburban branch will come to dominate children's clothing taking the kid downtown is too much of a production , household gadgetry and the discount business in big-ticket items. department stores were built on dry goods , especially ladies" fashions , and in this area , in the long run , the suburban branches will be hard put to compete against downtown. if this analysis is correct , the suburban branches will turn out to be what management's cost accountants refuse to acknowledge , marginal operations rather than major factors. historically in america the appeal of cities has been their color and life , the variety of experience they offered. " how ya gonna keep "em down on the farm "" ? ? was a question that had to be asked long before they saw paree. though americans usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious belief , they liked to work and shop in the noise and vitality of downtown. only a radical change in the nature of the population in the central city would be likely to destroy this preference and we must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change , gloomily foreseen by so many urban diagnosticians , is actually upon us. 4. suburbs and negroes in their book , american skyline , christopher tunnard and henry hope reed argue that franklin roosevelt's new deal was what made the modern suburb a possibility a fine ironical argument , when you consider how suburbanites tend to vote. the first superhighways new york's henry hudson and chicago's lake shore , san francisco's bay bridge and its approaches , a good slice of the pennsylvania turnpike were built as part of the federal works program which was going to cure the depression. at the same time , roosevelt's federal housing administration , coupled with henry morgenthau's cheap-money policy , permitted ordinary lower-middle-class families to build their own homes. bankers who had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house itself got that security from the u. s. government ; ; householders who had been unable to pick up the burden of short-term high-interest mortgages found they could borrow for twenty-five years at 4 per cent , under government aegis.

whenever artists , indeed , turned to actual representations or molded three-dimensional figures , which were rare down to 800 b.c. , they tended to reflect reality see plate 6a , 9b ; ; a schematic , abstract treatment of men and animals , by intent , rose only in the late eighth century. to speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment. at the least , however , one may conclude that geometric potters sensed a logical order ; ; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the homeric epics and the hexameter line. their world , again , was a still simple , traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life. and perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure. the storms of the past had died away , and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to disturb men's minds. throughout the work of the later ninth century a calm , severe serenity displays itself. in the vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or repel one in its internal self-satisfaction , but the best of the geometric pins have rightly been considered among the most beautiful ever made in the greek world. the ninth century was in its artistic work " the spiritually freest and most self-sufficient between past and future "" , and the loving skill spent by its artists upon their products is a testimonial to their sense that what they were doing was important and was appreciated. the aegean in 800 b.c. geometric pottery has not yet received the thorough , detailed study which it deserves , partly because the task is a mammoth one and partly because some of its local manifestations , as at argos , are only now coming to light. from even a cursory inspection of its many aspects , however , the historian can deduce several fundamental conclusions about the progress of the aegean world down to 800 b.c.. the general intellectual outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now consolidated to a significant degree. much which was in embryo in 1000 had become reasonably well developed by 800. in this process the minoan-mycenaean inheritance had been transmuted or finally rejected ; ; the aegean world which had existed before 1000 differed from that which rises more clearly in our vision after 800. those modern scholars who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of aegean development from earliest times granted occasional irruptions of peoples and ideas from outside are correct ; ; but all too many observers have been misled by this fact into minimizing the degree of change which took place in the early first millennium. the focus of novelty in this world now lay in the south-eastern districts of the greek mainland , and by 800 virtually the entire aegean , always excepting its northern shores , had accepted the geometric style of pottery. while protogeometric vases usually turn up , especially outside greece proper , together with as many or more examples of local stamp , these " non-greek "" patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century. in their place came local variations within the common style tentative , as it were , in protogeometric products but truly distinct and sharply defined as the geometric spirit developed. attica , though important , was not the only teacher of this age. one can take a vase of about 800 b.c. and , without any knowledge of its place of origin , venture to assign it to a specific area ; ; imitation and borrowing of motifs now become ascertainable. the potters of the aegean islands thus stood apart from those of the mainland , and in greece itself argive , corinthian , attic , boeotian , and other geometric sequences have each their own hallmarks. these local variations were to become ever sharper in the next century and a half. the same conclusions can be drawn from the other physical evidence of the dark ages , from linguistic distribution , and from the survivals of early social , political , and religious patterns into later ages. by 800 b.c. the aegean was an area of common tongue and of common culture. on these pillars rested that solid basis for life and thought which was soon to be manifested in the remarkably unlimited ken of the iliad. everywhere within the common pattern , however , one finds local diversity ; ; greek history and culture were enduringly fertilized , and plagued , by the interplay of these conjoined yet opposed factors. further we cannot go , for the dark ages deserve their name. many aspects of civilization were not yet sufficiently crystallized to find expression , nor could the simple economic and social foundations of this world support a lofty structure. the epic poems , the consolidation of the greek pantheon , the rise of firm political units , the self-awareness which could permit painted and sculptured representations of men all these had to await the progress of following decades. what we have seen in this chapter , we have seen only dimly , and yet the results , however general , are worth the search. these are the centuries in which the inhabitants of the aegean world settled firmly into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the hellenic outlook , independent of outside forces. to interpret , indeed , the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate defect born of our lack of detailed information ; ; if we could see more deeply , we probably would find many side issues and wrong turnings which came to an end within the period. the historian can only point out those lines which were major enough to find reflection in our limited evidence , and must hope that future excavations will enrich our understanding. throughout the dark ages , it is clear , the greek world had been developing slowly but consistently. the pace could now be accelerated , for the inhabitants of the aegean stood on firm ground. chapter 5 the early eighth century the landscape of greek history broadens widely , and rather abruptly , in the eighth century b.c. , the age of homer's " rosy-fingered dawn "". the first slanting rays of the new day cannot yet dispel all the dark shadows which lie across the aegean world ; ; but our evidence grows considerably in variety and shows more unmistakably some of the lines of change. for this period , as for earlier centuries , pottery remains the most secure source ; ; the ceramic material of the age is more abundant , more diversified , and more indicative of the hopes and fears of its makers , who begin to show scenes of human life and death. figurines and simple chapels presage the emergence of sculpture and architecture in greece ; ; objects in gold , ivory , and bronze grow more numerous. since writing was practiced in the aegean before the end of the century , we may hope that the details of tradition will now be occasionally useful. though it is not easy to apply the evidence of the iliad to any specific era , this marvelous product of the epic tradition had certainly taken definitive shape by 750. the dipylon geometric pottery of athens and the iliad are amazing manifestations of the inherent potentialities of greek civilization ; ; but both were among the last products of a phase which was ending. greek civilization was swirling toward its great revolution , in which the developed qualities of the hellenic outlook were suddenly to break forth. the revolution was well under way before 700 b.c. , and premonitory signs go back virtually across the century. the era , however , is janus-faced. while many tokens point forward , the main achievements stand as a culmination of the simple patterns of the dark ages. the dominant pottery of the century was geometric ; ; political organization revolved about the basileis ; ; trade was just beginning to expand ; ; the gods who protected the greek countryside were only now putting on their sharply anthropomorphic dress. the modern student , who knows what was to come next , is likely to place first the factors of change which are visible in the eighth century. not all men of the period would have accepted this emphasis. many potters clung to the past the more determinedly as they were confronted with radically new ideas ; ; the poet of the iliad deliberately archaized. although it is not possible to sunder old and new in this era , i shall consider in the present chapter primarily the first decades of the eighth century and shall interpret them as an apogee of the first stage of greek civilization. on this principle of division i must postpone the evolution of sculpture , architecture , society , and politics ; ; for the developments in these areas make sense only if they are connected to the age of revolution itself. the growing contacts between aegean and orient are also a phase which should be linked primarily to the remarkable broadening of hellenic culture after 750. we shall not be able entirely to pass over these connections to the east as we consider ripe geometric pottery , the epic and the myth , and the religious evolution of early greece ; ; the important point , however , is that these magnificent achievements , unlike those of later decades , were only incidentally influenced by oriental models. the antecedents of dipylon vases and of the iliad lie in the aegean past. dipylon pottery the pottery of the first half of the eighth century is commonly called ripe geometric. the severe yet harmonious vases of the previous fifty years , the strong geometric style of the late ninth century , display as firm a mastery of the principles underlying geometric pottery ; ; but artists now were ready to refine and elaborate their inheritance. the vases which resulted had different shapes , far more complex decoration , and a larger sense of style. beyond the aesthetic and technical aspects of this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broader lines. in earlier centuries men had had enough to do in rebuilding a fundamental sense of order after chaos. they had had to work on very simple foundations and had not dared to give rein to impulses. the potters , in particular , had virtually eschewed freehand drawing , elaborate motifs , and the curving lines of nature , while yet expressing a belief that there was order in the universe. in their vases were embodied the basic aesthetic and logical characteristics of greek civilization , at first hesitantly in protogeometric work , and then more confidently in the initial stages of the geometric style. by 800 social and cultural security had been achieved , at least on a simple plane ; ; it was time to take bigger steps , to venture on experiments. ripe geometric potters continued to employ the old syntax of ornaments and shapes and made use of the well-defined though limited range of motifs which they had inherited. in these respects the vases of the early eighth century represent a culmination of earlier lines of progress. to the ancestral lore , however , new materials were added. painters left less and less of a vase in a plain dark color ; ; instead they divided the surface into many bands or covered it by all-over patterns into which freehand drawing began to creep. wavy lines , feather-like patterns , rosettes of indefinitely floral nature , birds either singly or in stylized rows , animals in solemn frieze bands see plates 11 - 12 all these turned up in the more developed fabrics as preliminary signs that the potters were broadening their gaze. the rows of animals and birds , in particular , suggest awareness of oriental animal friezes , transmitted perhaps via syrian silver bowls and textiles , but the specific forms of these rows on local vases and metal products are nonetheless greek. though the spread of this type of decoration in the aegean has not yet been precisely determined , it seems to appear first in the cyclades , which were among the leading exporters of pottery throughout the century. as the material at the command of the potters grew and the volume of their production increased , the local variations within a common style became more evident. plate 12 illustrates four examples , which are ripe or late geometric work of common spirit but of different schools.

if she were not at home , mama would see to it that a fresh white rose was there. sometimes , mrs. coolidge would close herself in the green suite on the second floor , and play the piano she had brought to the white house. mama knew she was playing her son's favorite pieces and feeling close to him , and did not disturb her. all the rest of the days in the white house would be shadowed by the tragic loss , even though the president tried harder than ever to make his little dry jokes and to tease the people around him. a little boy came to give the president his personal condolences , and the president gave word that any little boy who wanted to see him was to be shown in. backstairs , the maids cried a little over that , and the standing invitation was not mentioned to mrs. coolidge. the president was even more generous with the first lady than he had been before the tragedy. he would bring her boxes of candy and other presents to coax a smile to her lips. he brought her shawls. dresses were short in the days of mrs. coolidge , and spanish shawls were thrown over them. he got her dozens of them. one shawl was so tremendous that she could not wear it , so she draped it over the banister on the second floor , and it hung over the stairway. the president used to look at it with a ghost of a smile. mrs. coolidge spent more time in her bedroom among her doll collection. she kept the dolls on the lincoln bed. at night , when mama would turn back the covers , she would have to take all the dolls off the bed and place them elsewhere for the night. mama always felt that the collection symbolized mrs. coolidge's wish for a little girl. among the dolls was one that meant very much to the first lady , who would pick it up and look at it often. it had a tiny envelope tied to its wrist. an accompanying sympathetic letter explained that inside the envelope was a name for mrs. coolidge's first granddaughter. mama knew this doll was meant to help mrs. coolidge overcome her grief by turning her eyes to the future. the name inside the envelope was " cynthia "". the coolidges" life , after the death of their son , was quieter than ever. john was away at school most of the time. mrs. coolidge would knit , and the president would sit reading , or playing with the many pets around them. now and then , the president would call for " little jack , master of the hounds "" , which was his nickname for a messenger who had worked in the white house since teddy roosevelt's administration , and discuss the welfare of some one of the animals. it was part of little jack's work to look after the dogs. one white house dog was immortalized in a painting. that was rob roy , who posed with mrs. coolidge for the portrait by howard chandler christy. to get him to pose , mrs. coolidge would feed him candy , so he enjoyed the portrait sessions as well as she did. i would like to straighten out a misconception about the dress mrs. coolidge is wearing in this painting. it is not the same dress as the one on her manikin in the smithsonian. people think the dress in the picture was lengthened by an artist much later on. this is not true. the dress in the painting is a bright red , with rhinestones forming a spray on the right side. there is a long train flowing from the shoulders. mrs. coolidge gave mama this dress for me , and i wore it many times. i still have the dress , and i hope to give it to the smithsonian institution as a memento , or , as i more fondly hope , to present it to a museum containing articles showing the daily lives of the presidents if i can get it organized. but to get back to the coolidge household , mrs. coolidge so obviously loved dogs , that the public sent her more dogs calamity jane , timmy , and blackberry. the last two were a red and a black chow. rob roy remained boss of all the dogs. he showed them what to do , and taught them how to keep the maids around the white house in a state of terror. the dogs would run through the halls after him like a burst of bullets , and all the maids would run for cover. mama did not know what to do whether to tell on rob roy or not since she had the ear of mrs. coolidge more than the other maids. but she was afraid the first lady would not understand , because rob roy was a perfect angel with the first family. every day , when the president took his nap , rob roy would stretch out on the window seat near him , like a perfect gentleman , and stare thoughtfully out the window , or he would take a little nap himself. he would not make a sound until the president had wakened and left for the office ; ; then he would bark to let everyone know the coast was clear. his signal was for the other dogs to come running , but it was also the signal for mama and the other maids to watch out. rob roy was self-appointed to accompany the president to his office every morning. rob roy was well aware of the importance of this mission , and he would walk in front of the president , looking neither to the right nor to the left. at dinner , lunch , or breakfast , the president would call out , " supper "" ! ! he called all meals supper after the butler had announced the meal. all the dogs would dash to get on the elevator with the president and go to the dining room. they would all lie around on the rug during the meal , a very pretty sight as rob roy , prudence , and calamity jane were all snow-white. when prudence and blackberry were too young to be trusted in the dining room , they were tied to the radiator with their leashes , and they would cry. mama tried to talk to them and keep them quiet while she tidied up the sitting room before the first family returned. finally , mama did mention to mrs. coolidge that she felt sorry for the little dogs , and then mrs. coolidge decided to leave the radio on for them while she was gone , even though her husband disapproved of the waste of electricity. mama was now the first maid to mrs. coolidge , because catherine , the previous first maid , had become ill and died. mrs. coolidge chose mama in her place. it was a high mark for mama. every first family seems to have one couple upon whom it relies for true friendship. for the coolidges , it was mr. and mrs. frank w. stearns of boston , massachusetts , owners of a large department store. they seemed to be at the white house half the time. the butlers were amused because when the stearns were there , the president would say grace at breakfast. if the stearns were not there , grace would be omitted. speaking of breakfast , the president inaugurated a new custom that of conducting business at the breakfast table. the word was that this too was part of an economy move on his part. a new bill had been passed under harding that designated the government , rather than the president , as the tab-lifter for official meals. so the president would make a hearty breakfast official by inviting government officials to attend. he caused a lot of talk when he also chose the breakfast hour to have the barber come in and trim his hair while he ate. mama said that if presidents were supposed to be colorful , mr. coolidge certainly made a good president. he knew exactly how to be colorful ! ! the favorite guest of the house , as far as the staff was concerned , was mr. wrigley , the chewing gum king. the white house had chewing gum until it could chew no more , and every christmas , mr. wrigley sent the president a check for 100 , to be divided among all the help. you can imagine that he got pretty good service. another good friend of the coolidges" was george b. harvey , who was the ambassador to great britain from 1921 to 1923. he had been a friend of the hardings , and continued to be invited by the coolidges. the first royalty whom mama ever waited on in the white house was queen marie of rumania , who came to a state dinner given in her honor on october 21 , 1926. she was not an overnight guest in the white house , but mr. ike hoover , the chief usher , had mama check her fur coat when she came in , and take care of her needs. mama said she was one of the prettiest ladies she had ever seen. mama was very patriotic , and one of the duties she was proudest of was repairing the edges of the flag that flew above the white house. actually , two flags were used at the mansion a small one on rainy days , and a big one on bright days. the wool would become frazzled around the edges from blowing in the wind , and mama would mend it. she would often go up on the roof to see the attendant take down the flag in the evening. she used to tell me , " when i stand there and look at the flag blowing this way and that way , i have the wonderful , safe feeling that americans are protected no matter which way the wind blows "". even when mrs. coolidge was in mourning for her son , she reached out to help other people in trouble. one person she helped was my brother. mama had told her how emmett's lungs had been affected when he was gassed in the war. he was in and out of mount alto hospital for veterans any number of times. taking a personal interest , she had the doctor assigned to the white house , dr. james coupal , look emmett over. as a result , he was sent to a hospital in arizona until his health improved enough for him to come back to washington to work in the government service. but again , there was danger that his lungs would suffer in the muggy washington weather , and he had to return to the dry climate of the west to live and work. when mrs. coolidge was in mourning , she did not wear black. she wore grey every day , and white every evening. mama knew that she was out of mourning when she finally wore bright colors. the president helped her a lot by selecting some lovely colored dresses to get her started. she opened the boxes with a tear in her eye and a sad smile on her face. on the social side , the chore mama had at the formal receptions at the white house thrilled her the most. it was her job to stand at the foot of the stairs , and , just as the first lady stepped off the last tread , mama would straighten out her long train before she marched to the blue room to greet her guests with the president. mama would enjoy the sight of the famous guests as much as anyone , and would note a gown here and there to tell me about that night. one night , mama came home practically in a state of shock. she had stood at the bottom of the stairs , as usual , when mrs. coolidge came down , in the same dress that is now in the smithsonian , to greet her guests. mama stooped down to fix the train , but there was no train there ! ! she reached and reached around the dress , but there was nothing there. she looked up and saw that , without knowing it , mrs. coolidge was holding it aloft. mrs. coolidge looked down , saw mama's horrified expression and quickly let the whole thing fall to the floor. mama swirled the train in place , and not a step was lost. the coolidges did not always live at the white house during the presidency.

salvation of the lord.
such was my state of mind that i did not question the possibility of this ; ; under the circumstances i was only too willing to confess all. i was nearly thirty at the time. i went to the hall in the afternoons only , on these preliminary matters. it was dark and , i sensed , very large ; ; only the counter at one end was lighted by a long fluorescent tube suspended directly above it. sometimes i was aware of people moving about in the darkness. i would turn away from my writing in the hope of getting a good look at them but i never quite succeeded. a glimpse of three of four vague figures , at the most. drifting here and there. squatting , as if waiting. the pulsing glow of a cigarette. since they could see me but i not them , their presence in the hall disturbed me. the clerk paid them no attention. this impressed me , until i realized how limited was his sphere of influence. his job simply consisted in registering new men. when the phone rang he answered it. his authority extended to the far edge of the counter , no further. none of the men hanging around the hall bothered to speak to him. baldness was attacking his pate. he spoke to me in a gruff voice , an affectation which quite belied his personality. he wore his white shirt open at the neck , revealing a bit of scrawny pale chest underneath. it was obvious that he wished himself different from the sort of person he thought he was. but it was not easy for him and he often slipped. when one of the men in the hall behind us spat on the floor and scraped his boot over the gob of spittle i noticed how the clerk winced. i felt certain he was really a spineless little man. his hat the cause of his baldness ? ? hung on a hook on the wall , and underneath it i could see his tie , knotted , ready to be slipped over his head , a black badge of frayed respectability that ought never to have left his neck. the morning's tabloids were on the counter , and a stack of dog-eared men's magazines. on a shelf in the office behind the counter was a small radio dialed permanently on a station which broadcast only vulgar commercials and cheap popular music. everything about the clerk was trivial. once , pressing him , i learned that his job was only part-time , in the afternoons when nothing went on in the hall. noticing my disappointment he attempted to salvage what scraps and shreds of authority he felt might still be clinging to his person. with distaste i saw him assume a pompous air. when he saw me coming he turned his radio off. he made a show of rearranging my forms on the shelf. he would pick up the ringing phone with studied negligence , then bark into it with gruff importance. what limited knowledge he possessed he forced upon me. in the mornings , i was informed , fluorescent tubes , similar to the one above the counter , illuminated the entire hall. they , and the two large fans which i could dimly see as daylight filtered through their vents , down at the far end of the hall , could be turned on by a master switch situated inside the office. he pointed out the switch to me and for a moment i foolishly believed that he would let deed follow words. i was shown , instead , a batch of white tickets of the sort handed out , he told me , every morning. now , here was something of obvious importance to me , yet when i reached for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand. he could not afford to have anyone mess around with them , he said. each of those tickets was of great value to its rightful recipient. i withdrew my hand. later i would remember what this pompous little man had told me about the worth of a ticket. having nothing else to do except wait for my forms to be processed , i gave myself over to speculations concerning the hall itself. when suitably lighted , what would it look like ? ? the presence of the two exhaust fans seemed to indicate that the hall could become crowded for air. one afternoon , upon receiving permission and the necessary instructions from the clerk , i had visited the toilet adjoining the hall. by counting the number of stalls and urinals i attempted to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall would hold at one time. for although i had crossed a corner of the hall on my way to the toilet i still could not tell for sure how far to the rear the darkness extended. i could observe the two fans down at the end , but their size in themselves meant nothing to me as long as i had no measure of comparison. i had for some time been hoping , in vain , for one of the dim figures to pass between the fan vents and myself. i knew that three or four of them were almost always present in the hall , but what they were doing , and exactly where , i could not tell. it was , i felt , possible that they were men who , having received no tickets for that day , had remained in the hall , to sleep perhaps , in the corners farthest removed from the counter with its overhead light. this light did not penetrate very far back into the hall , and my eyes were hindered rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through the fan vents when i tried to pick out whatever might be lying , or squatting , on the floor below. also the clerk appeared to disapprove of my frequent curious glances back over my shoulder. no sooner would i turn my head away from the counter before he would address me , at times quite sharply , in order to bring back my attention. and i had hardly finished my business in the toilet on the aforementioned occasion when the lights in that place , like the hall lights controlled from the switch in the office , flicked off and on impatiently. this sort of petty vigilance annoyed me. i felt certain it was self-appointed. it sprang from a type of mentality i'd encountered often enough but certainly had not expected to find here. i decided to see no more of the clerk until the processing of my papers was completed. i felt strongly attached to the hall , however , and hardly a day passed when i did not go to look at it from a distance. i lived in a state of suspense because of it. i could not cling to my past nor did i wish to. i had signed it off on the forms. my future lay solely with the hall , yet what did i know about the hall at this point ? ? although i had been inside it i had not yet seen it functioning. i wished to prepare myself but did not even know what sort of clothes i ought to be wearing. i did not despair , however ; ; far from it ! ! i was constantly searching for clues around the neighborhood of the hall. though only a relatively short walk separated it from my own part of town , its character was wholly foreign to me. large warehouses flanked the street on which the hall fronted. the river was only a few blocks away but an unbroken line of piers prevented me from seeing it. sometimes i noticed the tops of ships" masts and funnels reaching above the pier roofs. the sounds issuing from beyond winches whirring , men shouting indicated great activity and excited me. the hall , on the other hand , appeared lifeless and deserted on these long waterfront afternoons. it resembled nothing i'd ever seen before. its front was windowless , but irregularities in the masonry might be an indication that windows , now blinded , had once looked out upon the street. i kept circling the block hoping to see , from the street behind it , the rear of the hall. but it was not a tall structure and other buildings concealed it. for weeks i wandered about this neighborhood of warehouses and garages , truck terminals and taxi repair shops , gasoline pumps and longshoremen's lunch counters , yet never did i cease to feel myself a stranger there. i returned to the hall , despite my dislike for the clerk. as i had expected , he insisted that my visits to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application. meanwhile spring had passed well into summer. at last , when i put it to him directly , the clerk was forced to admit that the delay in my case was unusual. when i asked him what , if anything , i could do about it , he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall. i could consult this personage on any weekday morning , though not before ten o'clock. the clerk impressed this upon me : that i should not arrive in the hall before ten o'clock. when i went for my interview with the director i saw why. although it was dark as usual i could see that the hall had only recently contained a great many people. cigarette butts littered the floor. the big fans were going , drawing from the large room the remnants of stale smoke which drifted about in pale strata underneath the ceiling. i had felt the draft they were making while mounting the stairs. the staircase itself seemed still to be echoing the heavy footfalls of many men. i stopped by the counter. no one was behind it , but in the rear wall of the office i noticed , for the first time , a door which had been left partially open. past it i could see part part of a desk , a flag in a corner , a rug on the floor. the director's office. i rapped my knuckles on the counter. the director came to the door. i was at once disappointed , although just what i had expected him to look like i could not have explained. he was a man in his late forties , with graying hair , of medium height ; ; he looked dapper in a lightweight summer suit , brown silk tie and green-tinted soft collar. he wore perforated , white-topped shoes ; ; they somehow made me expect to see him launch into a vaudeville tapdance routine any moment. but he came toward me sedately enough , showed me around the counter , offered me a seat inside his office , then walked to a file cabinet and got out my application. i had the impression that he had read my forms , perhaps several times. he did not look at them now. as he lowered himself on the chair behind his desk i wondered what this dapper , slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to do with the workings of the hall. he spoke , in a voice as immaculate as his appearance. why had i registered ? ? begging my pardon , he must express his astonishment over seeing a person of my background applying at the hall. he had looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there ; ; indeed , my scholastic qualifications were such that he , a college graduate himself , must envy me them. was i sure , he asked , that i knew what i was applying for ? ? what sort of men i would come into contact with , at the hall ? ? these questions did not surprise me ; ; i felt certain that the director , like the afternoon clerk , seldom moved beyond the counter , that the hall , to them , was a jungle , a dark and unwelcome place. though i doubted that he would understand me , i told the director my motives for applying. i had always , i said , hankered after working hard with my hands. this desire , i went on , growing voluble as my conviction was aroused , had mounted at such a rate recently that i now found its realization necessary not only to my physical but also to my spiritual wellbeing. to this effect i had already severed all connections which bound me to my former existence.

on the fringe of the amused throng of white onlookers stood a young woman of remarkable beauty and poise. she munched little ginger cakes called mulatto's belly and kept her green , somewhat hypnotic eyes fixed on a light-colored male who was prancing wildly with a 5-foot king snake wrapped around his bronze neck. the youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman. lithe and muscular , he had well-molded features , and his light color told of the european ancestors who had been intimate with the slave women of his family. the haughty white girl turned to a distinguished , hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured : " look at your watch , col. garvier. it is almost time for and calinda to begin "". col. henri garvier was one of new orleans" most important and enlightened slave owners. he chuckled and gave the signal for the dance to start. the slaves ran gaily to the center of congo square and gathered around a sweaty youth they called johnny no-name. johnny vigorously pounded two bleached steer bones against the gourd which served as his drum. he showed his gleaming tusks of teeth and bellowed incoherently , his brass earrings jangling discordantly as he shook and trembled in ecstasy. the drummer flogged the gourd with frantic intensity as the dancers began the calinda , a sensual gyration which had long been a favorite of voodoo practitioners and their disciples in the louisiana slave compounds. the dance was of haitian origin. the white girl with the penetrating green eyes sipped the lemonade handed to her by a handsome man of about 30 , who had coppery skin and beetling eyebrows. he was possessive in his manner and , though a slave , obviously was educated after a fashion and imitated the manners of his owners. he proudly wore the blue livery of her house , for the girl was madame delphine lalaurie , wife of the prominent surgeon , dr. louis lalaurie , who bore one of the south's oldest and most cherished names. delphine was a pace-setter in high society. she was a top horsewoman and one of the city's most gracious hostesses. although new orleans was not to learn of it for a spell , she also was a sadist , a nymphomaniac and unobtrusively mad the perpetrator of some of the worst crimes against humanity ever committed on american soil. madame lalaurie gestured with her riding crop toward the 20-year-old youth who was stomping and writhing with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders. the slender , handsome fellow was called dandy brandon by the other slaves. he was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure for women of any race. but dandy had had little experience with girls on his master's plantation in bayou st. john. shy , actually , he avoided feminine overtures and seemed truly ignorant of the girls" desires when they sought to make liaisons with him in the open fields , in carriages and in boathouses. this young slave was therefore quite unprepared when delphine lalaurie signaled that she wanted him to draw near. the woman eyed the youth with the avidity a coin collector might display toward a rare doubloon which is not yet in his collection. " what is your name , boy ? ? come a bit closer. i will not bite , you know "". he gaped at madame lalaurie and sniffed the paris perfume which emanated from her. then he smiled shyly. " my name is dandy brandon , missy. i belong to master alexander prieur "". she said with intense feeling : " come near , let me feel your arms. you look quite strong and healthy to me , dandy "". mrs. lalaurie impatiently propelled the slave toward her waiting carriage. lifting her skirts , she climbed in , never relinquishing her grip on his arm. the woman seemed utterly unafraid of the snake which coiled on the floor in a torpor. once inside the luxuriosly-upholstered landau , she drew the curtains and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination usually reserved for army inductees. satisfied at last , and after a few amorous gambits on her part which convinced delphine that dandy was capable of learning new arts , she opened the window and called to her liveried driver. this was the big man with the proprietory air and the beetling , shaggy eyebrows. " aristide ! ! i want you to find monsieur prieur at once and give him this money for the boy's purchase. there is 600 in gold in this chamois sack. if the old fool argues about the price , tell him i shall order my husband not to treat him as a patient any longer. prieur has gout and depends on louis" pills and bleedings. besides , he owns 300 slaves. one less should not matter to him "". aristide devol , the sardonic manservant who had been brought in chains years before from his native sierra leone , smiled thinly and touched his well-brushed beaver hat. his bold eyes raked the woman , and a perceptive spectator might sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner. " another youth , madame "" ? ? the coachman said softly. " this one is a tender chicken , oui ? ? such delicate beauty , such fine flesh. it will rip and shred easily for madame "". " be quiet , devol ! ! you are forgetting your place "". the tall coachman walked off briskly in search of alexander prieur. delphine lalaurie took the reins in her gloved hands and drove dandy brandon cowering in the back seat of the carriage to her mansion at 677 perdido street. dr. louis lalaurie stood on the veranda at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached the pillared mansion. dandy , curiosity overcoming his apprehensions , peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle. he saw a pint-sized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large head. dr. lalaurie wore a maroon smoking jacket , and his myopic eyes were blurry and glistened behind thick octagonal lenses. he was about 50 years old. " another young man , my dear ? ? really , you are most indiscreet to drive him here yourself "" , he said , frowning with displeasure. delphine presented her cheek for a kiss , and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster. " dandy is to be our house guest , louis. i want the room in the attic prepared for him he is a most unusual lad , quite precocious in many ways. he deserves a better life than just rotting away on the prieur plantation "". " quite so , my dear. his room will be ready shortly "". the physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory glance at the cringing slave. had dandy been older or wiser , instinct might have warned him that he would be well advised to flee from the lalauries" tender care if he valued his life. but he liked the smell of delphine's perfume. besides , her endearments and caresses in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth. also , he was weary of plantation drudgery and monotony. so dandy brandon trustingly entered the house with delphine lalaurie and trudged up the rear steps to the attic room which was to be his new home. airless and dingy though it was , the attic represented luxury to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers and sisters and assorted relatives in a shanty at bayou st. john. he bounced exuberantly on the sagging bed and was even more delighted when madame lalaurie after closing the door showed the slave that the bed was designed for something other than slumber. it was just as well that the ignorant dandy enjoyed himself to the hilt that first evening , for the room was to become his prison cell. when he finally left the sinister mansion on perdido street , he was carried out in a coroner's basket. just six weeks after dandy brandon's arrival at the mansion , the little surgeon and his svelte young wife gave their annual open house and ball , to which only new orleans" oldest and wealthiest families were invited. a stringed orchestra played softly behind the potted palms , and delphine circulated graciously among her guests , chatting airily of the forthcoming races , the latest fashions from paris , and louisiana politics. suddenly there was a commotion upstairs , a despairing boyish shriek , and the strains of the waltz faltered and died as the musicians and guests gaped at an apparition descending the marble staircase. it was dandy brandon , clad only in a bloody loincloth , emaciated and quaking as if the devil were breathing hard on him. the lad's once superb body was a mass of scars and welts. his pinched face showed the ravages of malnutrition. feebly he pointed an accusing finger at madame lalaurie and shouted : " evil woman ! ! you did this you like to hurt to beat people i want to go home "". these were the last words he ever uttered. convulsively , he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of senator gaston berche , crimsoning the frilly shirt and waistcoat the politician wore. dr. louis lalaurie examined the inert form of the slave on the parquet dance floor and pronounced him dead. the ball broke up in confusion. guests stared with horror at madame lalaurie and made speedy departures. delphine stood like stone , her eyes alive with hate as she looked down at the sheeted corpse. but at the coroner's inquest delphine told a forthright story. " i saw the boy dandy at the congo square festivities and felt sorry for him. it was our hope to educate him and to give him his freedom when the right time came , for he was a bright and friendly youth who seemed worthy of our interest. after i paid monsieur prieur for dandy , i brought him home , but he was ill at ease and ran away the same night. how he returned in such a ghastly condition , or why , i cannot say. dr. lalaurie and i did not even know he was in the house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs "". she daubed at her swimming eyes with a lacy handkerchief and said with obvious emotion : " that poor boy ! ! he must have fallen in with evil companions , for he was a simple youth and quite trusting and inexperienced. ruffians must have robbed and beaten him before bringing him back to our house to die. such a pitiful end "" ! ! though the slave's dying words about the woman troubled the coroner's panel , dandy's accusation was adjudged an aberration by the jury and disregarded. the lalauries were at the top rung of the social ladder , and even a jury did not feel privileged to doubt the veracity of so illustrious a lady. moreover , runaway slaves frequently got into serious trouble in new orleans" dives. so the verdict was " death at the hands of a person or persons unknown "" , and the elite of the city , accepting delphine's testimony , welcomed her and the doctor back into the fold. once again life went its serene way soirees , fox hunts , balls and dinners. the excitement over brandon's bizarre death abated and madame lalaurie's stock soared when she resumed her self-imposed chores of visiting the poor and bringing cakes and comfort to destitute patients in the county hospital. then , on july 2 , there occurred another incident which set tongues to wagging at a furious clip. mrs. victor dominique , socially prominent and a neighbor of the lalauries , chanced to glance out of her parlor window at dusk one evening and beheld an amazing sight. the manservant devol and his mistress , delphine lalaurie , were pursuing a young girl an octoroon of cameo-like beauty across the front lawn of the lalaurie mansion. the girl was not more than 16. she was nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not conceal the knife slashes on her back. the bleeding girl was tiring fast ; ; the coachman and delphine were gaining on her as she raced down perdido street. the fugitive cried out in an oddly sibilant voice : " help me , somebody ! ! they have pulled out all my teeth and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw ! !

special districts in rhode island. it is not within the scope of this report to elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in rhode island. however , a word should be mentioned in regard to them as independent units of government. there are forty-seven special district governments in rhode island excluding two regional school districts , four housing authorities , and the kent county water authority. these forty-seven special purpose governments have the authority to levy taxes , to borrow money , own property , sue and be sued , and in general to exercise normal corporate powers. unlike cities and towns , however , they do not have to submit any financial statements to the state bureau of audits. it is not an exaggeration to say that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units of government. in addition to the collection of service charges , the special districts levy annual property taxes of approximately 450,000. fiscal years in other states comparative data. a review of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity is pertinent to this report. included in the findings are : 1. forty-six states , including rhode island , end their fiscal year on june 30. the other four states end on varying dates : alabama sept. 30 , new york march 31 , pennsylvania may 31 , and texas august 31. 2. in sixteen states , the fiscal year ending of the cities june 30 is the same as that of the state : alaska , arizona , california , delaware , massachusetts , montana , nevada , new mexico , north carolina , north dakota , oklahoma , oregon , vermont , west virginia , wyoming , and hawaii. 3. in eleven states , the fiscal year of the cities ends on december 31 , while the state fiscal year ends on june 30 arkansas , colorado , indiana , kansas , new hampshire , new jersey , ohio , south dakota , utah , washington , and wisconsin. 4. in eight states whose fiscal years close on june 30 , a majority of their cities close their fiscal year on december 31 : : georgia , iowa , kentucky , maine , maryland , minnesota , virginia , and south carolina. 5. one state , alabama , closes its fiscal year on september 30 , and all cities in the state , with one exception , also close fiscal years on september 30. 6. mississippi closes its fiscal year on june 30 , while all of its cities close their fiscal years on september 30. 7. pennsylvania closes its fiscal year on may 31. all of its cities close their fiscal years on december 31. the remaining twelve states have varying fiscal years for the state , city and local governments. however , only illinois , oregon , louisiana and rhode island have a situation in which the sundry units of government vary widely in relation to fiscal uniformity. fiscal uniformity : advantages and disadvantages advantages. an excellent summary of advantages concerning the uniform fiscal year and coordinated fiscal calendars was contained in a paper presented by a public finance authority recently. he listed among the values of fiscal uniformity : 1. the uniform fiscal year requires compliance with common sense administration of local finances : adoption of the budget , or financial plan , in advance of spending. 2. the uniform fiscal year ensures conformance with another common sense rule , that of having cash in the bank before checks are drawn. it enables towns to make more economical purchases and to take advantage of cash discounts. 3. the uniform fiscal year promotes more careful budgeting and strengthens control over expenditures. by fixing the tax rate in advance of spending , upper limits are set on expenditures. 4. the uniform fiscal year brings the town's fiscal year into line with that of the schools , which expend the largest share of local disbursements. this greatly simplifies the town's bookkeeping and financial reporting. 5. the uniform fiscal year eliminates interest charges on money borrowed in the form of tax anticipation notes. furthermore , tax collections not immediately needed for current expenditures may be invested in short-term treasury notes , augmenting the town's miscellaneous revenues and reducing the tax levy. 6. the uniform fiscal year facilitates inter-town comparison of revenues and expenditures. when towns have the same fiscal year it is relatively easy to make meaningful comparisons ; ; and as the cost of local government increases , the demand for such comparison also increases. towns having different fiscal years are difficult to compare. of all advantages , probably none is more important than the elimination of tax anticipation notes. borrowing in anticipation of current taxes and other revenues is a routine procedure of the majority of municipalities at all times. it may be by bank loans , sale of notes or warrants , or by the somewhat casual method of issuance and registration of warrants. in any event it is a form of borrowing which could be and should be rendered unnecessary. its elimination would result in the saving of interest costs , heavy when short-term money rates are high , and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always available when needed most. this type of borrowing can be reduced to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of taxes is instituted and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year. any approach toward such a system looks toward saving and security. it should be noted that there are other and equally important reasons for establishing meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases on a uniform fiscal year. both the federal and state governments commence their fiscal years on july 1. both units of government contribute increasingly large sums of money to the several local governments in this state as indicated below : it has been said that when local government revenues were mostly produced locally from the property tax , the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great handicap ; ; but with the growth of state and federal fiscal aid , the emphasis on equalization , and the state-local sharing of responsibility for certain important functions , this is no longer true. the haphazard fiscal year calendar is an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient state-local revenue and expenditure relationships. disadvantages. although there are many sound reasons for adopting uniform and coordinated fiscal years in rhode island , there are also certain difficulties encountered. these involve more the mechanics employed in adjusting to fiscal uniformity than they do actual disadvantages to the principle. one problem is a matter of shifting dates ; ; the other , is how to finance the transition. little can be done about the changing of dates. this is an inherent part of adjusting fiscal calendars. it usually means a confused and disgruntled tax-paying public for a period of time. but cooperation and understanding between local officials and the citizenry help lessen this problem. the other problem is the matter of financing the transition period in the several cities and towns. this will be covered more fully later. it should be kept in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial condition of that town or city. fortunately , there are no cities or towns in the state , with one or two possible exceptions that are in too difficult a position to finance the proposed change. sacrifice will have to be made in some cases , but it is to the municipality's advantage to finance the change-over for a short period of time rather than pay interest on tax anticipation notes indefinitely. adjusting the fiscal calendars the advantages of a uniform fiscal year and well synchronized fiscal and tax collection calendars are sufficiently great for rhode island municipalities to exert effort to secure them. the type of program desired can be determined by the nature and extent of the adjustments needed. two features are immediately evident. first , the present situation is too varied to be systematized by any single formula. second , the shift to a uniform july 1 to june 30 fiscal year will , of itself , improve the tax collection calendars of the great majority of cities and towns. there are at least two problems to consider : one is a matter of adjusting the fiscal calendar ; ; the other is how to finance the adjustments when necessary. the latter matter is considered in detail in a later section. twelve cities and towns in rhode island presently indicate some plans to establish a uniform and/or coordinated fiscal tax year calendar. plans vary from the " talking stage "" to establishing special committees to accomplish this end. what is important here is that many of the cities and towns recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the initiative to obtain them. an analysis of the fiscal tax collection year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition may not be as painful as is commonly thought. however , it must be stressed that much depends upon the financial condition of the individual cities and towns involved. the adjustments needed to establish a uniform and coordinated fiscal tax collection year calendar throughout rhode island , based on a july 1 to june 30 year , are shown below. no adjustment needed. six cities and towns are presently on a july 1 to june 30 fiscal year and have coordinated their tax collection year with it. no change is required for these towns. these municipalities include : barrington , lincoln , middletown , newport , north kingstown , and south kingstown. adjustment of fiscal year. one town and one city , coventry and east providence , require an adjustment of their fiscal year only. this change will automatically adjust their tax collection year calendar so as to make all tax installments due and payable in the fiscal year collectible within that year. adjustment of tax collection year. six cities and towns are now on a july 1 to june 30 fiscal year and will need only to adjust their tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity. these cities and towns include bristol , glocester , pawtucket , cumberland , central falls , and woonsocket. simultaneous adjustments. two cities to be considered , providence and cranston , are an enigma. both have excellent integration of their fiscal tax collection year calendars. however , neither of these two cities is on the desired july 1 to june 30 fiscal year. the adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal period could be accomplished relatively easily for them. in that both cities end their fiscal years on september 30 , they could levy taxes for an interim period of nine months , commencing with september 30 and ending with june 30. these three installment dates would be : october 26 , january 26 , and april 25 providence and november 15 , february 16 and may 15 cranston. both would start their new fiscal year on july 1. their tax collection calendar could then be : july 25 , october 26 , january 26 , and april 25 , providence ; ; and august 15 , november 15 , february 17 , and may 15 , cranston. under this plan both cranston and providence would be on the uniform fiscal year but would still be using the same installment periods. varying adjustments. the remaining twenty-three towns have fiscal years which end prior to june 30. all of these towns will require adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection years. assuming an adjustment to the july 1 to june 30 fiscal year , the required adjustment of the tax collection years and the towns involved are shown in table 3. methods of financing adjustments aside from the matter of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars , there is the problem of financing the adjustment when this is necessary. it should be emphasized strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of interim budgets do not necessarily mean financing over and above normal governmental requirements. in many communities there is simply no financial problem ; ; it is only a matter of adjusting accounting methods , careful fiscal planning and management , or some like combination of techniques. in other municipalities the difficulties in overcoming the financial burden have been sufficiently great to dishearten proponents of fiscal year changes. fortunately , such cases in rhode island are more the exception than the rule. as shown earlier in table 1 , the several cities and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax collection calendars. in addition , no two rhode island communities are identical in relation to their over-all financial condition. these factors practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible ; ; each situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective tax calendars , the financial condition of the treasuries , and the length of the transition interval. suitable plans range from those that are very easy to develop to those that are difficult to formulate and require borrowing ranging from short-term serial notes to long-term bonds. the financial problem , where it exists , usually stems from the adoption of a budget for the transitional or adjustment period. for those communities which have financial difficulties in effecting adjustments , there are a number of alternatives any one of which alone , or in combination with others , would minimize if not even eliminate the problem.

" dammit , phil , are you trying to wreck my career ? ? because that is what you are doing wrecking it , wrecking it , wrecking it "" ! ! griffith had confronted hoag on the building's front steps hoag had been permitted no further and backed him against a wrought-iron railing. his rage had built up as he made his way here from the second floor , helped by the quantity of champagne he had consumed. hoag said , " i did not send for you , leigh. i want the captain in charge. where is he "" ? ? " phil , for god's sake , go away. the undersecretary's in there. i told you there is nothing between midge and me , nothing. it's all in your mind "". a couple of sobs escaped him , followed by a sentiment that revealed his emotional state. " why , i am not fit to touch the hem of her garment "". " leigh , get a grip on yourself. it's not about you or midge. i have some security information about the prime minister "". griffith looked at him suspiciously through red-rimmed eyes. " not about me ? ? you mean it , phil ? ? you would not pull my leg , old man ? ? i did get you on the platform this morning "". " i am not pulling your leg. will you call that captain "" ? ? " no use , he will not come "". he peered closely at hoag in the gathering darkness. " what happened to your head "" ? ? " i was hit knocked out. now will you get him "" ? ? " he says i am to take the message "". he stared at hoag drunkenly. " who'd hit you in the head "" ? ? " it does not matter. you get back to the captain and tell him this : somebody's going to take a shot at the prime minister , and mahzeer is in on the plot. tell him under no circumstances to trust the prime minister with mahzeer "". griffith said , " that is impossible. mahzeer's the ambassador "". " nevertheless it's true "". " impossible "". griffith was trying to clear his head of the champagne fuzz that encased it. " i'll show you how wrong you are. mahzeer and the prime minister are alone right now "". he nodded triumphantly. " so that proves it "" ! ! hoag looked terrified. " where are they "" ? ? " where'd you expect , the john ? ? mahzeer's office "". " where is that "" ? ? " facing us , two flights up. look , old man , you cannot go up. they will not even let you in the front door. so why do not you be a good boy and "" hoag grabbed him by the shoulders. " listen to me , leigh. if you want to spend another day in the state department another day you get in there and tell that captain what i told you "". he bit out the words. " and you know i can do it "". griffith raised placating hands. " easy does it , phil. i was just going. i am on my way "". he turned and fled into the house and made his way up the marble stairs without once looking back. on the second landing he paused to look for docherty , did not see him , and accepted a glass of champagne. he took several large swallows , recollected that docherty had gone up another flight , and decided he would be wise to cover himself by finding him. the way hoag was , no telling what he might say or do. he finished his champagne and climbed uncertainly to the next landing. at the top a uniformed officer blocked further progress. " yes , what is it "" ? ? he asked. " i want captain docherty "". he spotted docherty coming out of a room at the far end of the corridor and called to him. docherty said , " it's okay , bonfiglio , let him by "". they walked toward each other. " well "" ? ? griffith said , " hoag told me to tell you "" he waited until they were close ; ; it was hideously embarrassing " not to let the prime minister be alone with mahzeer "". griffith looked half-crocked to the captain ; ; it would be just like him. " why not "" ? ? " he claims mahzeer's in a plot to kill the p.m. "". docherty went taut : was it possible ? ? could the ambassador himself be the man on this side the prime minister feared ? ? not possible , he thought ; ; the prime minister knew who his enemy was here ; ; he was not going to allow himself to be led meekly to the slaughter. and if by some wild chance mahzeer was the man , he would not dare try anything now not after docherty had looked in on the two of them to see that all was well. docherty was damned if he would make a fool of himself again the way he had earlier over the laundry truck. one more muddleheaded play like that one and they'd be leading him away. still , this had to be checked out. " where'd your friend hoag get his information "" ? ? he asked. " have not the faintest , captain "". " would you mind sending him up here ? ? i'd like to talk to him "". troubled , he continued along the corridor , poking his head into the next office for a careful look around. but hoag had not stayed on the front steps when griffith disappeared into the building. he was unwilling to rely on griffith's carrying his message , and he had no confidence the police would act on it. if mahzeer was alone with the prime minister he could be arranging his execution while hoag stood out here shivering in the darkening street. he would have to do something on his own. but what ? ? the door opened and three men and a woman in a sari swept past him and down the stairs. in the lighted interior he saw other men and women struggling into their wraps. these were the early departures ; ; in half an hour the reception would be over. if mahzeer was planning to set up the prime minister for muller he would have to do it in the next few minutes. hoag descended the stone steps to the street and looked up at the building. wide windows with many small leaded panes swept across the upper stories. on the second floor he saw the animated faces of the party guests ; ; the scene looked like a christmas card. on the third floor one of the two windows was lighted ; ; it was framed in maroon drapes , and no faces were visible. this would be mahzeer's office. he and the prime minister would be back from the window , seated at mahzeer's desk ; ; they would be going over papers mahzeer had saved as excuse for just such a meeting. in a minute , or five minutes , the business would be done ; ; mahzeer would stand up , the prime minister would follow. mahzeer would direct the prime minister's attention to something out the window and would guide him forward and then step to one side. the single shot would come ; ; hoag would carry its sound to his grave. mahzeer , of course , would be desolate. how was he to suspect that an assassin had been lurking somewhere across the street waiting for just such a chance ? ? hoag turned. where across the street ? ? where was muller waiting with the rifle ? ? narrow four-story buildings ran the length of the block like books tightly packed on a shelf. most of them could be eliminated ; ; muller's would have to be one of the half dozen almost directly opposite. the legation was generously set back from the building line ; ; if the angle of fire were too great the jutting buildings on either side would interfere. would the shot come from a roof ? ? he ran his eye along the roof copings ; ; almost at once a figure bulked up. but dully glinting on the dark form were the buttons and badge of a policeman. with a cop patrolling the road muller would have to be inside a building if he was here at all , and not waiting for the prime minister somewhere between this street and the terminal building at la guardia airport. hoag crossed the narrow street , squeezing between parked cars to reach the sidewalk. from this side he could see farther into the legation's third-story window , but he saw no faces ; ; the room's occupants were still seated or they had been called into the hallway by an alarmed police captain. if only the latter were true. he walked rapidly along the buildings scanning their facades : one was a club that was out ; ; two others he ruled out because all their windows were lighted. that left three , possibly four , one looking much like the next. he climbed the steps of the first and opened the door to the vestibule. he quickly closed it again. he had assumed that all these buildings had been divided into apartments , but this one , from a glance at the hall furnishings , was obviously still a functioning town house , and its owners were in residence ; ; that made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans had to be made in advance. he went on to the next building and found what he expected the mingled cooking aromas of a public vestibule. on one wall was the brass front of a row of mailboxes ; ; there were six apartments. now what ? ? the names on the mailboxes meant nothing to him. this was senseless he had no idea what to look for. he peered in the boxes themselves ; ; all were empty except one , and that one was jammed with letters and magazines. the occupants of apartment number 3 were probably away for a few days , and not likely to return on a friday. had muller made the same deduction ? ? muller was attracted to the lore of mailboxes. he opened the inner door ; ; the cooking odors were stronger all over the city , at this hour , housewives would be fussing over stoves. he climbed , as quickly as he could urge his body , up the two unbroken flights to the third floor , pulling himself along on a delicate balustrade , all that remained of the building's beauty. he paused on the landing to steady his breathing and then bent to examine the single door by the light of the weak bulb overhead. now he was certain : the lock had not yielded to muller's collection of keys ; ; fresh scars showed that the door had been prized open. it had been shut again , but the lock was broken ; ; he noted with a thrill of fear that the door moved under his touch. what was he to do now ? ? he had thought no further than finding muller. he realized now he had more than half hoped he would not find him that muller would not be here , that the attempt would be scheduled for somewhere beyond hoag's control. he could not break in on an armed man. he would have to climb back down to the street and signal a cop. was there time ? ? his thoughts were scattered by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door. hoag pushed open the door : at the far end of the long dark room muller was faintly silhouetted against the window , the rifle still raised ; ; he stood with his feet apart on a kitchen table he had dragged to the sill. he turned his head to the source of the disturbance and instantly back to the window and his rifle sight , dismissing hoag for the moment with the same contempt he had shown in their encounter at hoag's apartment. hoag stretched his left hand to the wall and fumbled for the switch : evil flourishes in the dark. the room was bathed in light at the instant muller's second shot came. muller , nakedly exposed at the bright window like a deer pinned in a car's headlights , threw down the rifle and turned to jump from the table ; ; his face wore a look of outrage. a shot caught him and straightened him up in screaming pain ; ; a following volley of shots shattered glass , ripped the ceiling , and sent him lurching heavily from the table. he was dead before his body made contact with the floor. hoag stumbled back into the hall , leaned against the wall , and started to retch. after captain docherty sent arleigh griffith for hoag he was able to complete his detailed inspection of the third floor and to receive a report from his man covering the floors above before griffith returned , buoyed up by a brief stop for another glass of champagne.

till of a sudden unlook'd for by defiles through the woods, gain'd at night,
this event, while it raised the spirits of elinor,
the recent experiments in the new poetry-and-jazz movement seen by some as part of the " san francisco renaissance "" have been as popular as they are notorious. " it might well start a craze like swallowing goldfish or pee-wee golf "" , wrote kenneth rexroth in an explanatory note in the evergreen review , and he may have been right. under the general heading " poetry-and-jazz "" widely divergent experiments have been carried out. lawrence ferlenghetti and bruce lippincott have concentrated on writing a new poetry for reading with jazz that is very closely related to both the musical forms of jazz , and the vocabulary of the musician. even musicians themselves have taken to writing poetry. judy tristano now has poems as well as ballads written for her. but the best known exploiters of the new medium are kenneth rexroth and kenneth patchen. rexroth and patchen are far apart musically and poetically in their experiments. rexroth is a longtime jazz buff , a name-dropper of jazz heroes , and a student of traditional as well as modern jazz. in san francisco he has worked with brew moore , charlie mingus , and other " swinging "" musicians of secure reputation , thus placing himself within established jazz traditions , in addition to being a part of the san francisco " school "". although patchen has given previous evidence of an interest in jazz , the musical group that he works with , the chamber jazz sextet , is often ignored by jazz critics. downbeat did not mention the los angeles appearance of patchen and the sextet , although the engagement lasted over two months. the stated goal of the cjs is the synthesis of jazz and " serious "" music. patchen's musicians are outsiders in established jazz circles , and patchen himself has remained outside the san francisco poetry group , maintaining a self-imposed isolation , even though his conversion to poetry-and-jazz is not as extreme or as sudden as it may first appear. he had read his poetry with musicians as early as 1951 , and his entire career has been characterized by radical experiments with the form and presentation of his poetry. however , his subject matter and basic themes have remained surprisingly consistent , and these , together with certain key poetic images , may be traced through all his work , including the new jazz experiments. from the beginning of his career , patchen has adopted an anti-intellectual approach to poetry. his first book , before the brave 1936 , is a collection of poems that are almost all communistic , but after publication of this book he rejected communism , and advocated a pacifistic anarchy , though retaining his revolutionary idiom. he spoke for a " proletariat "" that included " all the lost and sick and hunted of the earth "". patchen believes that the world is being destroyed by power-hungry and money-hungry people. running counter to the destroying forces in the world are all the virtues that are innate in man , the capacity for love and brotherhood , the ability to appreciate beauty. beauty as well as love is redemptive , and patchen preaches a kind of moral salvation. this salvation does not take the form of a christian heaven. in patchen's eyes , organized churches are as odious as organized governments , and christian symbols , having been taken over by the moneyed classes , are now agents of corruption. patchen envisions a dark kingdom which " stands above the waters as a sentinel warning man of danger from his own kind "". the dark kingdom sends angels of death and other fateful messengers down to us with stern tenderness. actually heaven and the dark kingdom overlap ; ; they form two aspects of heavenly life after death. patchen has almost never used strict poetic forms ; ; he has experimented instead with personal myth-making. much of his earlier work was conceived in terms of a " pseudo-anthropological "" myth reference , which is concerned with imaginary places and beings described in grandiloquent and travelogue-like language. these early experiments were evidently not altogether satisfying to patchen. beginning in cloth of the tempest 1943 he experimented in merging poetry and visual art , using drawings to carry long narrative segments of a story , as in sleepers awake , and constructing elaborate " poems-in-drawing-and-type "" in which it is impossible to distinguish between the " art "" and the poetry. art " makings "" or pseudo-anthropological myths did not meet all of patchen's requirements for a poetic frame of reference. many of his poems purported to be exactly contemporary and political ; ; so during the period approximately from 1941 to 1946 , patchen often used private detective stories as a myth reference , and the " private eye "" as a myth hero. speaking in terms of sociological stereotype , the " private eye "" might appeal to the poet in search of a myth for many reasons. the private detective at least in the minds of listeners and readers all over the country is an individual hero fighting injustice. he is usually something of an underdog , he must battle the organized police force as well as recognized criminals. the private detective must rely , as the youngest son or trickster hero does in primitive myth , on his wits. the private detective is militant against injustice , a humorous and ironic explorer of the underworld ; ; most important to patchen , he was a non-literary hero , and very contemporary. in 1945 , probably almost every american not only knew who sam spade was , but had some kind of emotional feeling about him. in the memoirs of a shy pornographer 1945 patchen exploited this national sentiment by making his hero , albert budd , a private detective. but since 1945 , sam spade has undergone a metamorphosis ; ; he has become friday on dragnet , a mouthpiece of arbitrary police authority. he has , like so many other secular and religious culture symbols , gone over to the side of the ruling classes. obviously , the " private eye "" can have no more appeal for patchen. to fill the job of contemporary hero in 1955 , patchen needed someone else. it was logical that he would come up with the figure of the modern jazz musician. the revolution in jazz that took place around 1949 , the evolution from the " bebop "" school of dizzy gillespie to the " cool "" sound of miles davis and lennie tristano , lee konitz , and the whole legend of charlie parker , had made an impression on many academic and literary men. the differentiation between the east coast and west coast schools of jazz , the differences between the " hard bop "" school of rollins , and the " cerebral "" experiments of tristano , konitz and marsh , the general differences in the mores of white and negro musicians , all had become fairly well known to certain segments of the public. the immense amount of interest that the new jazz had for the younger generation must have impressed him , and he began working toward the merger of jazz and poetry , as he had previously attempted the union of graphic art and poetry. in addition to his experiments in reading poetry to jazz , patchen is beginning to use the figure of the modern jazz musician as a myth hero in the same way he used the figure of the private detective a decade ago. in this respect , his approach to poetry-and-jazz is in marked contrast to kenneth rexroth's. rexroth uses many of his early poems when he reads to jazz , including many of his chinese and japanese translations ; ; he usually draws some kind of comparison with the jazz tradition and the poem he is reading for instance , he draws the parallel between a poem he reads about an oriental courtesan waiting for the man she loves , and who never comes , and the old blues chants of ma rainy and other negro singers but usually the comparison is specious. rexroth may sometimes achieve an effective juxtaposition , but he rarely makes any effort to capture any jazz " feeling "" in the text of his poems , relying on his very competent musicians to supply this feeling. patchen does read some of his earlier works to music , but he has written an entire book of short poems which seem to be especially suited for reading with jazz. these new poems have only a few direct references to jazz and jazz musicians , but they show changes in patchen's approach to his poetry , for he has tried to enter into and understand the emotional attitude of the jazz musician. it is difficult to draw the line between stereotype and the reality of the jazz musician. everyone knows that private detectives in real life are not like sam spade and pat novak , but the real and the imaginary musician are closely linked. seen by the public , the musician is the underdog par excellence. he is forced to play for little money , and must often take another job to live. his approach to music is highly individualistic ; ; the accent is on improvisation rather than arrangements. while he is worldly , the musician often cultivates public attitudes of childlike astonishment and naivete. the musician is non-intellectual and non-verbal ; ; he is far from being a literary hero , yet is a creative artist. many of these aspects will be seen as comparable to those of the ideal detective , but where the detective is active and militant , the jazz musician is passive , almost a victim of society. in order to write with authority either about musicians , or as a musician , patchen would have to soft pedal his characteristically outspoken anger , and change at least for the purposes of this poetry from a revolutionary to a victim. he must become one who knows all about the injustice in the world , but who declines doing anything about it. this involves a shift in patchen's attitude and it is a first step toward writing a new jazz poetry. he has shown considerable ingenuity in adapting his earliest symbols and devices to the new work , and the fact that he has kept a body of constant symbols through all of his experiments gives an unexpected continuity to his poetry. perhaps tracing some of these more important symbols through the body of his work will show that patchen's new poetry is well thought out , and remains within the mainstream of his work , while being suited to a new form. henry miller characterized patchen as a " man of anger and light "". his revolutionary anger is apparent in most of his early poems. the following passage from " the hangman's great hands "" illustrates the directness of this anger. " anger will not help. i was born angry. angry that my father was being burnt alive in the mills ; ; angry that none of us knew anything but filth and poverty. angry because i was that very one somebody was supposed to be fighting for "". this angry and exasperated stance which patchen has maintained in his poetry for almost fifteen years has been successfully modulated into a kind of woe that is as effective as anger and still expresses his disapproval of the modern world. in his recent book , hurray for anything 1957 , one of the most important short poems and it is the title poem for one of the long jazz arrangements is written for recital with jazz. although it does not follow the metrical rules for a blues to be sung , the phrases themselves carry a blues feeling. " i went to the city and there i did weep , men a-crowing like asses , and living like sheep. oh , cannot hold the han" of my love ! ! cannot hold her little white han" ! ! yes , i went to the city , and there i did bitterly cry , men out of touch with the earth , and with never a glance at the sky. oh , cannot hold the han" of my love ! ! cannot hold her pure little han" ! ! "" patchen is still the rebel , but he writes in a doleful , mournful tone. neither of these poems is an aberration ; ; each is so typical that it represents a prominent trend in the poet's development. patchen is repeatedly preoccupied with death. in many of his poems , death comes by train : a strongly evocative visual image. perhaps patchen was once involved in a train accident , and this passage from first will and testament may have been how the accident appeared to the poet when he first saw it if he did : " lord , love us , look at all the disconnected limbs floating hereabouts , like bloody feathers at that and all the eyes are talking and all the hair are moving and all the tongue are in all the cheek.

the sentry was not dead. he was , in fact , showing signs of reviving. he had been carrying an enfield rifle and a holstered navy cap-and-ball pistol. a bayonet hung in a belt scabbard. he was partially uniformed in a cavalry tunic and hat. mike stripped these from him and donned them. he and dean tied and gagged the man , using his belt and shirt for the purpose. they dragged him inside the building. fiske joined them , unsteady on his feet. julia , seeing the bandage , rushed to him. " you are hurt "" ! ! she breathed. " i never felt better in my life "" , fiske blustered. he turned to susan and kissed her on the cheek. " thank you , my dear "" , he said. " you are very brave "". mike silenced them. " we'll talk later. first , we've got to get out of here "". " we'll grab horses "" , dean said. " the main bunch is outside , but there are some over there inside the wall "". mike debated it , trying to decide whether fiske was strong enough to ride. but it at least offered him a chance for living. he had none here. and , for the sake of julia and susan , it had to be tried. the guerrilla bivouac remained silent. light showed in the orderly room across the parade ground. someone evidently was on duty there. no doubt there would be men guarding the horses. about a dozen animals were held inside the stockade , as best mike could make out in the moonlight. evidently this was a precaution so that mounts would be available in an emergency. he handed the guard's rifle to fiske. " dean and myself will try to cut out horses to ride "" , he said. " we'll stampede the rest. you stay with the ladies. all of you be ready to ride hell for leather "". he added , " if this does not work out , the three of you barricade yourself in the house and talk terms with them "". he handed the bayonet to dean and kept the pistol. susan halted dean and kissed him. she clung to him , talking to him , and dabbing at her eyes. mike turned away. he was thinking that the way she had responded to his own kiss had not meant what he had believed it had. he felt unutterably weary. dean turned from susan and took julia fortune in his arms. he kissed her also , and with deep tenderness. she too began to weep. he released her and joined mike. " all right "" , he said. mike only said , " later "". " be careful , mclish "" ! ! susan said fiercely. " the way you were careful "" ? ? he snorted. " running around in the moonlight almost naked and slugging a man with a rock "" ? ? he kept going. he wanted no more sentimental scenes with her. he might say or do something foolish. something all of them would regret. he might tell her how sorry a spectacle she was making of herself , pretending to be blind to the way julia fortune had taken dean's affections from her. and using him , mike mclish , as a sop to her pride. he handed the bayonet to dean and kept the pistol. " stay well back of me "" , he said. " i am going to walk up to the horses , bold as brass , pretending i am one of the guerrillas. there is bound to be someone on guard , but the hat might fool them long enough for me to get close "". holding the pistol concealed , he walked to the rear wall of the stockade. it was pierced by a wagon gate built of two wings. one wing stood open. mike passed through it and moved toward the dark mass of horses. they were tethered , army style , on stable lines. a voice spoke near-at-hand. " who's that "" ? ? just me "" , mike said. " is that you , bill "" ? ? he located his man. the guard stood in the shadow of the stockade wall just out of reach of the moonlight. mike kept walking and got within arm's reach before the man became suspicious and straightened from his lax slouch. mike struck with the muzzle of the pistol. but the luck that had been running their way left him. the guard instinctively parried the blow with his rifle. he tried to veer the rifle around to fire into mike's body. mike , off balance , managed to bat the muzzle away a moment before it exploded. the bullet went wide. mike swung the pistol in a savage backlash. this time it connected solidly on the man's temple , felling him. the explosion of the rifle had crashed against the walls of the stockade and the deep echoes were still rolling in the hills. the startled horses began rearing on their tethers. dean came rushing up. " are you hit "" ? ? he demanded. " no , but the fat's in the fire "" ! ! mike said. " there is no chance now of all of us getting away. you'll have to try it alone "". the sentry's saddled horse stood picketed nearby , having been kept handy in case of need. mike took the bayonet from dean's hand and slashed the picket line. " up you go "" ! ! he said. " ride "" ! ! dean resisted mike's attempt to push him toward the horse. " why not you "" ? ? he protested. " dammit "" ! ! mike said frantically. " you are lighter than me. it's our only chance now. try to find these feds. the rest of us can fort up in the house and hang on until you get back. you are the one that is taking the big chance "". dean still hesitated , but mike lifted him almost bodily into the saddle and thrust the reins in his hand. " no telling how good this horse is "" , mike panted. " favor him and save something in case you hit trouble. watch out for apaches when it comes daylight. take the pistol. you might need it. we'll still have the rifle , and i might be able to round up some more. i'll stampede the rest of these horses so they cannot chase you "". dean leaned from the saddle and gave him a mighty whack on the back. " mclish "" , he said as he kicked the horse into motion , " i'd be a mighty sad man if we never met again "". then he was on his way at a gallop. mike ran down the line , slashing picket ropes with the bayonet. he lifted a screeching war whoop. that touched off a total stampede. he darted inside the stockade and freed the horses there. these poured through the gate and joined the flight. the animals thundered away into the moonlight , heading for the ridges. the guerrillas were swarming from their bivouac at the west end of the enclosure. " apaches "" ! ! mike yelled. " they are stealin" the stock "" ! ! he scuttled in shadow along the east wall of the stockade and then followed the south wall until he was at the rear of the two frame buildings. he crouched there. his shout had been taken up and repeated. the guerrillas were running across the parade ground and through the rear gate in the wake of the departing horses. all were carrying guns they had seized up , but they were half-clad or hardly clad at all. durkin and calhoun came running from the post. they had pistols in their hands. they bawled questions that were not answered in the uproar. they followed the others toward the east gate. beyond the stockade rifles began to explode as some of the guerrillas fired at shadows that they imagined were apaches. mike made a dash to the rear of the frame buildings. he crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner. the area was deserted. a man was standing in the open door of the lighted orderly room a few yards to mike's left , but he , too , suddenly made up his mind and went racing to join the confused activity at the east end of the stockade. mike crawled to the door and peered in. the orderly room seemed to be deserted. a lantern hung from a peg , giving light. ducking inside , he found that three rifles were stacked in a corner. a brace of pistols , holstered on belts , hung from a peg , along with ammunition pouches. an ammunition case stood open , containing canisters which contained powder cartridges. mike seized a blanket from a pallet in a corner , spread it on the floor and used it to form a bag in which he placed his booty. shouldering the load he peered from the door. his looting of the orderly room had taken only a minute or two and the vicinity was still clear of guerrillas. he looked at the looming hoods of the supply wagons , struck by a new inspiration. he set his bundle down. snatching the lantern from its peg , he shattered its globe with a blow against a post. he picked up the powder canister and ran out. bursting paper cartridges , he scattered powder beneath the nearest wagon and dumped the contents of the canister upon it. he shouldered the blanket again , backed off , and tossed the lantern with its open wick beneath the wagon. he turned and raced across the parade ground toward the rock house. powder flame gushed beneath the wagon. the stockade was brilliantly lighted and the guerrillas sighted him. they realized the truth. bullets began to snap past him. one struck the muzzle of one of the rifles that projected from the shoulder pack. its force spun him around , but he recovered and got into stride again. a bullet tore the earth from beneath his foot when he was a stride or two from safety. another struck him heavily in the thigh and he went down. guerrillas were racing toward him. susan and julia came from the door and dragged him with them. the three of them floundered through the door into the interior and fell in a heap. susan bounced to her feet and slammed the door. she crouched aside as bullets beat at the portal , chewing into the planks. some tore entirely through the whipsawed post oak. the iron hinges held , but the planks were in danger of being torn from the crossbars. mike rolled to susan , grasped her around the knees , dragging her off her feet. he hovered over her to shield her , for spent bullets were thudding against the rear walls. he peered from a loophole. guerrillas were only a dozen yards away , charging the house. mike snatched a pistol from the heap of scattered booty and fired. he dropped a man with the first bullet. at the same moment wheeler fiske fired the rifle mike had given him and another guerrilla was hit. that halted the rush. the guerrillas scattered for cover. the wagons were burning fiercely. the mudwagon had caught fire also. the blaze was spreading to the frame buildings. the guerrillas realized they faced a new problem. " gawdamighty "" ! ! one screeched. " there goes our grub an" ammunition "" ! ! " get a bucket line going "" ! ! calhoun shouted. " hurry ! ! hurry "" ! ! the guerrillas began a frantic search for pails in which to bring water from the spring. but what few containers they found were inadequate. many of them , in increasing panic , came running with water in their hats in a ludicrous effort. both buildings were in flames. the heat drove the guerrillas back. the roof of the command post began to buckle. " drag the wagons to the spring "" ! ! lew durkin yelled. " run "em right into the spring ! ! hustle "" ! ! one of the wagons erupted a massive pillar of flame. a sizable supply of powder had been touched off. the wagons and the coach were beyond saving and so were the buildings. the glow of the fire reached through the openings in the windows , giving light enough to examine mike's wound. the bullet had torn through the flesh just above the knee , inflicting an ugly gash that was forming a pool of blood on the floor. but it had missed the bone and had passed on through. susan and julia ripped strips from their clothing and bound the injury. mike tested the leg and found that he was able to hobble around on it.

shingled attic, of an august noon; this seems an additional argument
but one night dookiyoon moved in the direction of the women's lodge , where shades of night had gone to purify herself. with the blue flesh of night touching him he stood under a gentle hill caressing the flageolet with his lips , making it whisper. he saw her emerge suddenly , coming in her unhesitant fashion , her back stiff , her head erect , facing with contempt the night and whatever she would encounter , as if in her extreme disdain and indifference she would pass by all the outraged looks of those whom she might approach. in her dark , scornful fashion she proceeded to her destination , afraid of nothing , not even the evil spirits which kept her company in her time of bleeding. seeing her come , he caught his breath , feeling his heart bounce in him , and turned away , afraid now. even he , wanting her , afraid of her and not knowing how to press his suit , feared the evil presences in her metabolism more. his breath caught , and , trembling , he closed his eyes and stumbled off. going , he saw as often before some queer , hideous yellow face over his head , shining and weird like the old images which had invested him at other times like those that appear sometimes near the eyeballs when they are perhaps pressed by the thumbs. he cried out to her , his back turned. then he fled , not waiting to see if she minded him or took notice of his cry. but she heard him go. yet she did not hesitate and only turned slightly , her neck tall as she looked in his direction , and continued on her way toward the end of the camp. elsewhere others heard and stopped and waited , the women peering from their lodges then gathering in small , curious clusters. early spring came from her bed , from beside her half-drunk husband , walitzee , and stood at the entrance way to her lodge hearing the mild commotion , the sound of hushed voices. standing there she saw shades of night come through the trees and stop beside the lodge , silent , almost imperious , her body taut , simply standing without speaking or moving while the wife of walitzee waited , perhaps denying the dread that moved in her. when at last she could suffer the insult no longer , nor face the girl's scorn , she said in a voice overloud : " i shall call your father ! ! go back where you can bring no harm , or i will go and get the old man from his bed so he can see your shame "" ! ! but the girl said only , " tell him i am here , that i have come "". and it was not pile of clouds she meant. but now with real anger at last , something proud and indignant , early spring stood like a she wolf before her den and cried , " i will not shriek at you ! ! i will tell you to go , not begging. telling you "" ! ! and unsheathing the knife she used for curing hides she stepped away from the lodge , holding the knife at her side. " you bring only wickedness "" , she said and it was not to a child any longer but to another woman who had come to skirt her lodge with the cunning hunger of a wild animal. speaking in a low voice of loathing she went up to the girl , who stood with the same upright , scornful bearing and did not even look at the knife. " go take helsq'iyokom , your evil spirit , to the young boys "" , the woman said. " they do not have to face battle. i will not let your evil in. i will simply kill you first. now go "" ! ! the other women had come close now , their voices murmuring together until they stood buzzing in an angry knot , their threats mingling , rising , nagging at each other , each trying to make her indignation and anger felt. they picked up sticks and hurled them at the girl. the sticks fell like a shower around her and she felt them sting her flesh and send tiny points of pain along her thighs. they were all shouting at her as if she were the embodiment of the evil she brought. but she did not move , taking the words and the sticks in that old defiance of her extreme youth until suddenly pile of clouds came howling among them , swinging a great bullhide whip. " go back to your lodges "" ! ! he shouted. " a pack of dogs makes less noise "" ! ! he made the long whip sing and snap around their heads so that they ran screaming , some tripping over themselves in their flight. and early spring seized the whip and said : " if you must flog someone , let it be her , your daughter. drive the demons out of her and teach her to stay away from my husband "" ! ! but the old man turned on her , jerking the whip from her hand. " get into your hovel "" ! ! he spat. " go back to that double-married man of yours who so parades his fine body among the young women. keep him back , if you must tell me what to do. i will be the one to confront my daughter , not the wife of him who leads her to sin "" ! ! she retreated before the naked shame in the old man and the fury beyond it and sank into the darkness of her lodge where walitzee stirred , mumbling , sitting up in a half stupor to say : " what worrisome thing happens ? ? i thought i dreamed of wolves fighting "". but she went to him and pressed herself against his nakedness , smelling the stale odor of the whisky he had stolen from tuhulhulzote. she said , " there is nothing that concerns you here. lie back and go to sleep. but do not dream. do not let the wicked spirits enter your brain "". he sank back , sighing , and was soon asleep again. outside , the old man , beyond all the curses of the spirits his daughter bore , went to her and twisted the gnarled talons of his fingers in her hair and turned her and pushed her rudely ahead of him into the trees where the moon sent out a thousand arms. and , shoving her against a spruce , her back to him , he retreated with the whip and made it whine and crack in the damp air , shortening its arc until it narrowed to her flesh and the sound of it snarled and cracked , settling its own cruel demons on her shoulders while she stood as unchanged , as dark and motionless as ever , her eyes open and staring at the pale delineaments of the bark so close to her face. she said to him , her father , " how was i begotten , in pain or joy ? ? is it for me to be forbidden the flesh you made grow on me ? ? they all know your foolish name "" ! ! she stared at the pale tracings on the tree , hearing her breath refracted from it , her face close and touching at time the rough edges of the bark. she felt the lash bite and heard her father say in crazed monosyllables words which had no meaning , like , " unnnt ! ! sssshoo "" ! ! the sounds of an animal in rage and despair. suddenly the lash stopped fighting the air and she heard pile of clouds say in his high , quavering voice : " did you follow me to see my shame ? ? move from the line or i will settle the whip on you. move ! ! do you hear the anger of the whip's whine "" ? ? turning , the girl saw dookiyoon standing between , his narrow shoulders unbent , his arms hanging long and resigned. he said , " let me take her blows , for there are demons in me too "". then , without knowing why , she found herself running from them , fleeing wildly through the trees , dodging her own shadows until she came to a little hollow in the rocky ground with a big stone in the center behind which she knelt and hid , listening to the madness of her heart and wanting for once to cry. for a while the young men waited outside the lodge of tuhulhulzote , glorying in his harsh language as he talked with himself. he shouted like a hoarse old mastiff , his hair stiff and bristling. he ranted and prophesied the doom of his enemies , walking in circles in and out of his living place , drinking stolen whisky in great , gasping draughts until finally , incoherent and sick , he fell into his own oblivion. he amused the young men who had been silent long enough. but they could taste the appeasement of violence and retribution through his antics. now they moved , rubbing their flesh alive again , disdaining the gloom they saw in the faces around them. they came out and held their games and races. it was they who held the future in their hands. they went into the sun together and paraded grandly in their war clothes , painting their faces with the sacred attis dug far off in the cave of skeletons. they danced the paxam wildly at night , the war dance , and dipped their arrowheads in the venom of rattlesnakes and rode their horses in swift maneuvers , firing their few guns in unison at some indeterminate signal. walitzee was among them , and sarpsis , and they wore red blankets which flew like broad wings in the air of their passing. and a very young one , swan necklace , tried to emulate them and followed timidly. yellow wolf was there , nephew of the young chief by an older brother long dead , in whom also the disordered chemistries of youth worked. he would spring bolt upright suddenly after sitting quietly with inaction , because something had boiled over in his fermenting juices. all the young men , alokut among them , challenged them in matched racing. they raced and maneuvered for war , swinging their horses in single file and then abreast like cavalry. at times they would ride frenziedly through the camp , letting the women see their courage , how handsome they were in their regalia. then again they would stand in circles making other preparations. they combed their hair and streaked it at the part and greased the bangs so that the hair above their foreheads stood rigid like the tails of sage hens making love. walitzee whitened his leggings with clay , knowing the girl watched from her place in the trees. he saw himself in a superior reflection , and he was as a speeding arrow from the taut bow , hurtling with a mad grace , his maleness shining and scented with meadow rue. he was always aware of the women's eyes which followed him , admiring him. and the suspicious , envenomed eyes of pile of clouds. and those of early spring , haunted and now full of hurt and envy. he felt so much like laughing ; ; even like shouting and crying out from the hilltops from which he could descend as an eagle in a mad caper from the cliffs. he and sarpsis planned a great parade with the young men. they would give one final testimony of their challenge to let the people see their arrogance. they would ride with streaming amulets , their colors ripening in the sun , shouting the last bellicosity of a nation in the throes of death. and so the sun came up again and for a moment its color was the young men's blood , shifting then into the full heat and outcry which ran with their hearts. they mounted their horses and rode off into the hills. the , young chief stared at the wall of his lodge , , listening. the sound rose on the other side of the hills , vanished and rose again and he could imagine the mad , disheveled hoofs of the appaloosas , horses the white men once had called the dogs of hell. he saw them in fleet images as they came rolling and now burst across the ridge. standing then with the others , peering into the sun , he saw the bright , multicolored legion , their hair flying like dark banners , only the thunder , the roll of drums , the mad cacophony of the hoofs accompanying them. they leaned into the wind and seemed like one thousand-legged monster hurtling and plunging until suddenly they rose straight in their saddles and in one terrifying voice shouted , ejaculated their grotesque cry of war.
